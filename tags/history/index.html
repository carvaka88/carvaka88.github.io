    <h2><a href="/general/shivaji-samadhi/">Samadhi of Shivaji</a></h2>
    <p>Many Mumbai landmarks have been named renamed for Shivaji.  It is interesting to note that his Samadhi was poorly maintained until late 19th century</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/general/history/">History and Narratives</a></h2>
    <p>Frequently historians present themselves as objective observers just using evidence to presen the history.  However to me it appears that many have some framework and narrative in mind and then choose evidence to fit the story they want to tell.</p>
