  <p>I found these concepts challenging for me, not their use in symbol shuffling.  I planned to add (many?) more but never got around to it.</p>
<h2 id="tensors">Tensors</h2>
<p>To add to the confusion, AI uses tensors to mean multi-dimensional arrays - (0D) scalars, (2D) matrices and anything more (ND) tensors where N is greater than 2.</p>

<p>page 1</p>
<p>Some people can readily master the stilted mathematical language of generalized math theory without ever caring about what the equations mean in a physical sense — what a shame. Engineers and other “applications-oriented”  people  often  have  trouble  getting  past the  supreme  generality  in classical textbooks ..</p>
<p>page 2</p>
<p>Newcomers  to engineering tensor analysis will also eventually become exasperated by the apparent disconnects between jargon and definitions among practitioners in the field — some professors  define  the  word  “tensor”  one  way  while  others  will  define  it  so  dramatically differently that the two definitions don’t appe ar to have anything to do with one another.</p>
<h2 id="continuity">Continuity</h2>
<p>For those of us who had some difficulty with definition limits, epsilon, delta etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuity is the fundamental notin of topology, &hellip;  It took
mathematicians 200 years to arrive at a correct definition. (..
it was the search for a usable definition of continuity that led to
a correct definition of limits).&rdquo;</p>
