  <p>I found these concepts challenging for me, not their use in symbol shuffling.  I am sure there are better and more comprehensive explanations available.  I planned to add (many?) more but never got around to it.</p>
<h2 id="tensors">Tensors</h2>
<p>To add to the confusion, AI uses tensors to mean multi-dimensional arrays - (0D) scalars, (2D) matrices and anything more (ND) tensors where N is greater than 2.</p>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="http://www.mech.utah.edu/~brannon/public/Tensors.pdf">http://www.mech.utah.edu/~brannon/public/Tensors.pdf</a></strong></p>
<p>page 1</p>
<p>Some people can readily master the stilted mathematical language of generalized math theory without ever caring about what the equations mean in a physical sense — what a shame. Engineers and other “applications-oriented”  people  often  have  trouble  getting  past the  supreme  generality  in classical textbooks ..</p>
<p>page 2</p>
<p>Newcomers  to engineering tensor analysis will also eventually become exasperated by the apparent disconnects between jargon and definitions among practitioners in the field — some professors  define  the  word  “tensor”  one  way  while  others  will  define  it  so  dramatically differently that the two definitions don’t appe ar to have anything to do with one another.</p>
<h2 id="continuity">Continuity</h2>
<p>For those of us who had some difficulty with definition limits, epsilon, delta etc.</p>
<p><strong>Source: Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms, John H. Hubbard, Barbara Burke Hubbard</strong></p>
<p>(page 85)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuity is the fundamental notin of topology, &hellip;  It took
mathematicians 200 years to arrive at a correct definition. (..
it was the search for a usable definition of continuity that led to
a correct definition of limits).&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="russells-paradox">Russell&rsquo;s Paradox</h2>
<p>When I was first exposed to Set theory, I learnt about Russell&rsquo;s paradox.  To me it basically boils down to this.  A set can be defined either by enumerating all the elements of a set or by stating a &ldquo;set comprehension.  A set comprehension is a rule or a property shared by all the elements of the set.  Russell&rsquo;s Paradox states that a comprehension with no restrictions leads to contradictions.</p>
<h2 id="electrons-and-holes-in-semiconductors">Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors</h2>
<p>I found the explanation of hole and electron currents in semiconductors unsatisfactory until I learnt about valence electrons, energy bands etc.</p>
<p>Total current in a semiconductor is sum of electron current in conduction band and so called &ldquo;hole current&rdquo; in the valence band.  Hole current is an abstraction of movement of electrons in the valence band.  Electrons in the valence band are less mobile than the electrons in the conduction band.  It is easier to think about movement of electrons in the valence band as the motion of &ldquo;holes&rdquo; or &ldquo;absence of electrons&rdquo; in the opposite direction.</p>
<h2 id="nabla-operator-and-divergence">∇ operator and Divergence</h2>
<p>Divergence is represented as ∇<strong>.v</strong> i.e. a &ldquo;dot product&rdquo; of the ∇ operator and vector <strong>v</strong>.  It is not actually a dot product because <strong>v.</strong>∇ makes no sense.  It is just a notational convenience.</p>
