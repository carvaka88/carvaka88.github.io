  <p>Ali Dashti was born in 1896 in Dashtestan in Iran.  At a young age, he was
trained in Islamic theology, history, Arabic and Persian grammar, and
classical literature in madrasas in Karbala and Najaf (both in Iraq).</p>
<p><strong>Book: Twenty Three Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammed,
Ali Dashti (Translated from Persian by F.R.C. Bagley), George Allen and Unwin, 1985</strong></p>
<h2 id="ali-dashti">Ali Dashti</h2>
<p>Instead of becoming a cleric, he chose a career in journalism and
published a newspaper (Shafaq-e Sorkh) in Tehran from 1922 to 1935.
He was a member of Majlis at various times between 1928 and 1946.  His
criticism of allowing Tuda party into the cabinet and concessions to
the Soviets landed him in prison in 1946.  He was appointed a Senator in
1954.  He occupied this position until the Islamic revolution.  Apparently
he was arrested after the revolution and during one of the interrogations,
was beaten and broke his thigh.  He was released but not allowed to
return to his home.  An Iranian newspaper reported his death in 1981.</p>
<p>Dashti wrote Bist o Seh Sal and because of censorship in Iran had it
published anonymously in Lebanon.  Ali Dashti gave a copy of Bist o Seh
Sal to F.R.C. Bagley in 1975 and requested him to translate and publish
it only after Dashti&rsquo;s death.  Bagley believes this book is valuable
because it discusses both values and problems Islam presents to modern
Muslims.  Bagley says that modern Muslim scholars have not paid much
attention to difficulties and for the most part focussed on exposition
and apologia.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-prophet-muhammad">On the Prophet Muhammad</h2>
<p>Dashti says that although more information about Muhammad is available than
any other great men of history before him, there is a lack of &ldquo;objective
and rational&rdquo; book about him which is free of &ldquo;preconceptions,
suppositions and fanaticism.&rdquo;  Muhammad is turned into a superhuman figure
by presenting fantasies as miracles, while ample evidence of his humanity
is ignored.  He gives some historical examples of fabrication of history
and mythification.  Some of the examples which he cites, if presented out
of context, would certainly offend devout Muslims.  Dashti believes
Muhammad&rsquo;s greatness and genius stands unequaled in history especially
when the situation and circumstances under which he lived are considered.</p>
<p>Dashti notes the tendency of Muslim writers, in their zeal to emphasize
changes brought about by Islam, to depict the conditions in Mecca and
the rest of Arabia darker than they really were.  Based on research of some
modern Muslim scholars (page 14), the reaction against idolatry had begun
in the second half of the sixth century.  This was probably due to the
presence of Jewish tribes and work of some thinking men called &ldquo;hanifs.&rdquo;
Monotheism was not a novelty, some of the prophets mentioned in the
Quran are: Hud among the people of Ad, Saleh among the people of Thamud,
and Shoayab in Medyan.  Arabic sources mention several preachers who
appealed to the people to renounce idolatry (page 15).  Dashti produces
quotations from some pre-Islamic poets/preachers which could have been
composed by Muslims.  Dashti ends this section by noting that the modern
Arabic scholars disagree whether the poetry is genuinely pre-Islamic.  He
however believes that there is adequate evidence which points to
disillusionment with paganism and movement towards monotheism.</p>
<p>Dashti sees prophethood as mental and spiritual genius of extraordinary
individuals and rejects traditional understanding of principle of
prophethood.  He asks: if people are not going to believe because God has
confused them (6:110) and he has willed them so (6:107), what purpose
does it serve to send a prophet to guide them.  If idolaters were not to
blame for their beliefs, how can a merciful God cast them in hell for
eternity.</p>
<p>[I dont think there is anything new in this argument and I am sure
there are a number of Muslim scholars who have presented a counter
argument.]</p>
<p>Before his call to prophethood, Muhammad carried on long discussions with
Christian monks and priests during his business visits to Syria.  He also
met with a number of followers of the Scriptures while he was in Mecca.<br>
He was in touch with Khadija&rsquo;s (his first wife) cousin Waraqa b Naufal
who is supposed to have translated a part of the New Testament into Arabic.</p>
<p>Dashti speculates that Muhammad&rsquo;s childhood experience, his interaction
with various follower&rsquo;s of Scriptures coupled with his intense desire to
change, led to his belief in his prophethood.  He further speculates
on the revelations, their timing and the two verses which were supposed
to have been put into Muhammad&rsquo;s mouth by Satan and which were later
excised from the Quran.  He believes that Muhammad&rsquo;s inner doubts may have
been the cause of this incident.</p>
<p>Dashti believes that the Quran is badly edited and its contents &ldquo;obtusely&rdquo;
arranged.  The Suras have been arranged according to their length and many
Meccan verses are in Medinan Suras and Medinan verses in Meccan Suras.
Ali b. Abi Taleb had arranged the verses chronologically, however his copy
was lost.</p>
<p>Dashti says that the Quran can not be considered miraculous as far as
moral teachings are concerned.  Muhammad reiterated the principles which
have been conceived many centuries earlier and in many places.  The Quranic
laws and ordinances were formulated in response to random incidents and
petitions from aggrieved persons.  These were not sufficient for a large
and the growing community of Muslims a century and half after his death.</p>
<p>Pre-Islamic Arabs practiced fasting on the tenth day of Muharram which
coincided with Jewish Yom Kippur.  After Muhammad&rsquo;s emigration to Medina
the duration of fast was changed to first 10 days of Muharram and after
the final breach from Jews, the whole month of Ramadan was reserved for
fasting.  Around the same time, the direction of prayers was changed from
Jerusalem to Mecca.</p>
<p>Through hajj, several national customs of Arabs were endorsed and
perpetuated.  All the ceremonies of hajj such as wearing of seamless
white robe, kissing/touching of black stone, the halt at Arafat, running
between Safa and Marwa and the pebble-throwing were practiced in
pre-Islamic period.  While circumambulating the Kaaba, the call to
an idol was replaced by the call to God.  There are some minor modifications
such as banning circumambulation in nude which pagan Arabs practiced.
In regards to polygamy, divorce, adultery, fornication, sodomy etc,
the Islamic laws are modifications of Jewish laws or reforms of prevailing
Arab practice.  The obligations of Jihad (Holy war) and Zakat (alms-tax)
were necessary for the building of a state.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-religion-of-islam">On The Religion of Islam</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of Yathreb (pre-Islamic name of Medina) had adopted many
Jewish practices such as circumcision, ritual ablation, observance of
rest day (they chose friday instead of saturday).  There were some
individuals who shunned idolatry.  The preaching of Islam was a not a
novelty to the inhabitants of Yathreb.</p>
<p>In first 13 years of Muhammad&rsquo;s teaching, Islam did not prosper in
Mecca.  Muhammad never deviated from his lofty aim and was immune to
inducements, threats, taunts or persecution.  Initially Qurashites
mostly ignored him and were content in ridiculing him.  However, when
Muhammad&rsquo;s preaching won over influential members of the community, the
hostility increased.  The idol-temple of Kaaba and Mecca were the center of
annual pilgrimage and drew thousands every year.  Their existence and
prestige depended on this; they viewed Islam, which called for destruction
of the idols as a threat to their livelhood.  Muhammad emigrated to Medina
when he realized that he was in great danger.</p>
<h2 id="on-hajj">On Hajj</h2>
<p>Pilgrimage to Mecca and hajj rituals seem to have puzzled some Muslim
scholars.  The Islamic rituals are slightly modified versions of pagan Arab
practices.</p>
<p>The pagan Arabs circumambulated the Kaba, called out &rsquo;labbayka, O name
of one of the idols&rsquo; (Lat, Ozza, Manat etc).  This was replaced by
&rsquo;labbayka Allahomma labbayka.'</p>
<p>The pagan Arabs had banned hunting in the month of pilgrimage; in Islam
the ban is in effect only when the pilgrims are in the state of
consecration (ehram).</p>
<p>Sometimes the pagan Arabs circumambulated the Kaba in nude;
Islam requires pilgrims to wear seamless robes.</p>
<p>The pagan Arabs did not eat meat of sacrificed animals; Islam permits it.</p>
<p>Pebble throwing at Satan, halt at Arafat and kissing/touching the black
stone have been retained unchanged.</p>
<p>Both hills, Safa and Marwa had been sites of stone idols and
pagan Arabs ran between them and kissed the idols for good fortune (baraka).
Initially, several believers objected to running between Safa and Marwa
until the verse 2:153 was revealed.  Even Omar reportedly said he would
not have kissed the black stone had he not personally seen the Prophet
do so.</p>
<p>Ghazzali says that he found no explanation of hajj ritual.</p>
<p>Abul Ala al-Maarri exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People come from far corners of the land
to throw pebbles (at Satan) and to kiss the (black) stone.
How strange are the things they say!
Is all mankind becoming blind to truth&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verse 9:28 bans non-Muslims from visiting the Kaba.  This Surah was
revealed after Mecca was conquered.</p>
<p>Ali Dashti speculates that hajj was retained to guarantee a continuation
of means of livelihood to Meccans, most of whom became Muslims under
duress and were concerned about their prosperity.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-the-speaker-in-the-quran">Who is the speaker in the Quran?</h2>
<p>Dashti says that confusion as to who is speaking in the Quran, God or
the Prophet, exists.  Sometimes, God speaks commanding the Prophet to
&ldquo;say&rdquo; (Arabic qol) to the people and at other times, it is the Prophet who
speaks. (Page 151)</p>
<p>As an example of the Prophet speaking, he cites the first 7 verses of the
first surah.  In these verses God is praised and asked for guidance.
Reading these verses, Dashti seems to be right, God could not be praising
himself and asking himself for guidance. (Page 148)</p>
<p>Dashti asserts that this confusion is indisputable.  Has this presented a
problem for Muslim scholars?  If so, how has it been treated/resolved?</p>
<h2 id="errors-in-the-quran">Errors in the Quran?</h2>
<p>I have summarized some examples given by Dashti.  For copyright reasons
I can not type the whole thing.  If anyone believes I have distorted or
misrepresented, please post corrections and an explanation.</p>
<p>With a rich history of Islamic scholarship, I am sure each and every one
these has been explained.  Obviously, I can not pass any judgement on
any of this.</p>
<p>I wonder how many Muslims are aware that there are some aberrations
(at least superficially) which needed explanations and there was some
debate over this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Surah 74, First verse</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;O you who are clad in a cloak&rdquo;, the accepted reading for &ldquo;clad in
cloak&rdquo; is moddather, but according to Dashti there is widespread
opinion that it should be motadathther.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Surah 4 verse 160</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, the
believers &hellip;, and the performers of the prayer, and the prayers
of the alms tax,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word for &ldquo;performers&rdquo; is in the accusative case, whereas it ought
to be in the nominative case like the words for &ldquo;well-grounded&rdquo;,
believers, and the &ldquo;payers.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surah 49 verse 9</p>
<p>&ldquo;If two parties of believers have started to fight each other, make
peace between them,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verb meaning &ldquo;have started to fight&rdquo; is in the plural, whereas
it ought to be in the dual like its subject &ldquo;two parties.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surah 2 verse 172</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righteousness (berr) is not that you turn your faces to the east
and the west, but righteousness (berr) is he who believes in God
and the last day &hellip;. &quot;</p>
<p>Mohammad b Yazid ol-Mobarrad, the grammarian from the ninth
century suggested that the word should be read as barr. (He was
accused of irreverence and reviled.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dashti writes (p 50): &ldquo;To sum up, more than one hundred Quranic aberrations
from normal rules and structures of Arabic have been noted.  Needless to
say, the commentators strove to find explanations and justifications of
these irregularities.&rdquo;</p>
