  <h1>Punjabi in Pakistan</h1>

  
  
  
  

  <p>It is interesting to note that Abdus Salam, Nobel Prize winnner for Physics in 1979 gave his convocation address at Gurudev Nanak university of Amritsar on 25 January 1981 in rural Punjabi.  He also received his Nobel Prize in traditional Punjabi attire.  He needed some help in wrapping his turban around properly.</p>

<p>The fact that the annexation of Punjab was accomplished by the British through the Bengal Army , whose soldiers came predominantly from North India, created a permanent fault-line in relations between Punjabis, especially Sikhs, and the &lsquo;Hindustanis&rsquo; from North India whom the Punjabis called Purabias or kala . This fault-line became further entrenched when the Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus took revenge against the Purabias in the 1857 uprising by siding with the British.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Punjabi Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs became more entrenched in the agrarian economy and
Punjabi Hindus into the service sector.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The majority of the peasants and soldiers were Muslims and Sikhs, and the majority of the
traders and professionals were Hindus</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Pakistan Punjab became politically dominant in Pakistan but at the cost of surrendering regional Punjabi identity .</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Punjabi language has very little, if any, state support in Pakistan but the indications are that this is likely to change in favour of Punjabi in the future (Ayers , 2008)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Certainly most of the Punjabis and Pathans who dominate West Pakistan never really thought of the East Bengalis as fellow countrymen or even true Muslims, shared much of British racial contempt for them, and contrasted their alleged passivity with the supposedly virile qualities of the enthnicities dubbed by the British as &lsquo;martial&rsquo;, the Punjabis and Pathans.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(Urdu) It was never spoken by Muslims in Bengal - but then it has never been spoken by most of the people of what is now Pakistan either. &hellip; but the only people who speak it at home are the
Mohajirs in 1947, and who make up only 7 percent of Pakistan&rsquo;s populatinon.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century British colonial official Sir Thomas Metcalfe described the traditional villages of nothern India as &rsquo;little republics&rsquo;, administering their own justice, deciding
their own affairs, and paying only what tribute to the &lsquo;state&rsquo; could be extracted from them
by force.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As in medieval Europe, for most of South Asian history government was mostly indirect, and
implemented not by state officials but through local barons or tribal chieftains  - who
often revolted against the king, emperor or sultan if they felt that he was not treating them
with sufficient respect or generosity.</p>
<p>Not for nothing was an old Hindustani populat term for banditry &lsquo;padshahi kam&rsquo;, the imperial
trade.  This indicated not only that ordinary people could usually see no difference between
bandits and soldiers, but that they often changed places.  Unpaid soldiers become bandits,
successful bandits become soldiers of conquering armies and their leaders become kings.</p>

<p>Even all regional languages do not enjoy the same educational role and prestige as only Pashto and Sindhi languages are taught at the lower levels in khyberpakhtonkhaw and Sindh, but Punjabi is not allowed to be taught at school level (Siddiqui, 2011) the same idea was presented by Zaidi (2001) according to him one can get a master or PhD degree in Punjabi language but cannot use this language at school level.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In Ayres words (2008) : Such attitude towards Punjabi language has changed the behavior of people towards Punjabi as people do not recognize its fact moreover they feel reluctant in adopting this language. Rahman (2006) discussed that unfortunately, Punjabi is a source of cultural shame . In some elite class schools there are some policies which strictly forbidden students to speak Punjabi, but apart from this misfortune Punjabi is a huge language which, will survive it is widely used in India and Pakistan it is the language of songs , jokes, and informality .</p>

<p>Pakistani Punjabis&rsquo; negative attitude towards their language can be demonstrated by the fact that there is not a single newspaper or magazine published in Punjabi for the 60 million-plus Punjabi speakers. Historically, every Punjabi journalistic venture has died soon after its launching.</p>
<p>.&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it not significant that in Pakistan&rsquo;s history no Punjabi leader of stature has addressed a mass rally in Punjabi?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There are a number of universities in the Punjab, but it is only in the University of Lahore that a small MA Punjabi department exists, and even then the students admitted are more interested in finding a cheap residence in Lahore than in studying Punjabi.</p>

<p>Punjabi, being the most spoken as well as the most neglected language of the country, also came under discussion with heated debates and vehement views. It would not be wrong to say that the Punjabi-speaking community in Pakistan is unique in the world for unlike the general psyche of the people and ethnic-lingual societies, it does not bracket together any symptoms of pride, emotional foray, national prestige or social-cultural survival with its language.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Again it is a unique privilege that is enjoyed only by Punjabis in the whole world that they cannot read and write in their mother tongue and use a different language for this purpose.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We teach our children that the invaders, the Muslim rulers of different dynasties, are our heritage and their languages, such as Persian, too, are highly valuable for our religious and cultural education. It is shocking that we have Persian departments in many of our universities but have Punjabi departments in only one or two institutions and these too are not treated with due attention and patronisation. How many native Persian speakers are there in Pakistan?</p>

<p>In Punjab, unfortunately there is widespread culture-shame about Punjabi (Mansoor 1993: 132).  In all of the elitist English-medium schools the author visited, there are policies forbidding students from speaking Punjabi.  If anyone spoke it, s/he was called Paendu (&lsquo;rustic village yokel&rsquo;) and made fun of.  Manhy educated parents speak Urdu rathere than Punjabi with their children.</p>

<p>Till the late 1960s, Saraiki was considered to be a dialect of Punjabi, but Saraiki nationalists disagree and treat their language as a separate linguistic entity.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>n his 1985 book, Ramay suggests that the Punjabis turned against the Bengalis to safeguard the interests of those who had imposed Urdu (‘a foreign language’) upon them (the Punjabis).</p>
<p>Ramay continues by claiming that had the Punjabis continued to respect and love their own language, they would have understood the sentiments of East Pakistan’s Bengalis, and would not have turned against them.</p>
<p>The book was promptly banned by the intransigent Zia regime.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The ban did not deter Syed Ahmed Ferani from authoring Punjabi Zaban Marre Gi Nahi (The Punjabi Language Will Not Die) in 1988. This is an even more radical expression of Punjabi nationalism. Here Ferani describes Urdu as ‘a man-eating language’ that made Punjabis kill fellow Punjabis and then people of other non-Urdu ethnic groups. This book too was banned.</p>
<p>The third major work in this context is a novel authored by Fakhar Zaman called Bewatna (Stateless) in 1995. Zaman, another former PPP man in Punjab, wrote an allegorical lament about how (he thought) the Punjabis (by adopting alien languages and cultures) have become aliens on their own soil. The novel, too, was banned.</p>
<p>In a landmark decision, the Lahore High Court (in 1996), overturned and lifted the ban on all three books.</p>
<p>He specifically mentioned the erosion of Punjab’s original culture and traditions that were being replaced by a culture imported by those (including fellow Punjabis) who have for long resided in Arab countries &hellip;</p>

<p>In his Punjab ka Muqadama [Punjab’s Lawsuit] written over three decades ago, veteran politician Hanif Ramay lamented the fact that he had to write Punjabi’s case in Urdu, simply because the Punjabis have lost the ability to read and write their own language. Ramay bewailed that in order to become ‘Pakistani’ the Punjabis had discarded their own language and focused only on Urdu. The sole emphasis on Urdu meant that while the Punjabis became dominant in the civil-military bureaucracy in Pakistan, they did so at the expense of their own identity and culture. In fact in an ironic twist of history while this Punjabi-dominated ruling elite looked down upon our erstwhile compatriots, the East Bengalis, since they thought that they were not ‘Muslim enough’ and that the Bengali language was ‘too Hindu,’ they thought the same about their own culture and language too!</p>

<p>I was simply shocked that an international conference was being conducted in Punjabi! Such confidence and ease with the mother tongue is simply unthinkable in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This short dedicatory sentence very aptly summed up the book, as well as the stark reality. In this very well written book, Ramay laments the state of Punjabi in Pakistan noting, rightly, that in trying to become ‘Pakistani’ the Punjabis forgot their own ethnicity, culture and language. The ‘Speak Urdu, Read Urdu, and Write Urdu,’ campaign, he notes, did make Urdu the lingua franca of Pakistan, but killed the Punjabi language. He wonders if any in the Punjab can even read or understand, Waris Shah’s ‘Heer’, Maulvi Ghulam Rasool’s ‘Yousaf Zuleikha’, or Mian Muhammad Bakhsh’s ‘Saif ul-Mulook’.</p>
<p>Similarly, he grieves that even elements of Punjabi culture — its dress, food, household things, dances etc — are slowly dying out. ‘If other provinces did not wear the Kurta, even that would have died out in the Punjab,’ Ramay exclaims.</p>
<p>In trying to make ‘Pakistan’ synonymous with ‘Punjab’, the Punjabis discarded their language and culture and took on the more acceptable north India Muslim culture. Therefore, at the moment the Punjab is the only province in the country where there is no real provision for the promotion of its language and culture. People in Sindh are taught Sindhi in school and even some schools teach Pashto in Khyber-Pakhtunkhawa, and some schools Balochi in Balochistan. However, hardly any school teaches Punjabi in the Punjab.</p>
<p>At the higher education level, the University of the Punjab only started a Department of Punjabi in 1970 — which is eight years after the Indian side established a full-fledged Punjabi medium university! Even now, except for Punjab University, the Government College and Oriental College properly teach Punjabi, and other institutions only occasionally dabble in the language. The Punjabi medium is not even a consideration in Pakistani Punjab, and even the teaching of the language is still considered slightly odd in its own province.</p>

<p>However, the mother tongue of this privileged and numerically dominant group has no institutional support in Pakistan. All cultural, intellectual or professional  activity  of  the  community  takes  place  either in Urdu or in English.</p>
<p><strong>Souarce: <a href="http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/4600/1/02Khokhlova.pdf">http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/4600/1/02Khokhlova.pdf</a></strong></p>
<p>All  cultural,  intellectual  or professional  activity  of  the  community  takes  place  either  in  Urdu  or  in English. There are 36,750 Sindhi-medium schools in Sind and 10,731 Pashto- medium schools in the Northwestern Province, and both languages are also taught as compulsory subjects in these two provinces (Rahman 2002a: 515-524). However, there is not a single Punjabi-medium school, and Punjabi is  nowhere  taught  as  a  compulsory  subject. With  the  exception  of  several the mass media, and completely absent from government services. One can do  an  M.A.  or  a  Ph.D.  in  the  University  of  the  Punjab  in  Lahore,  but  it can hardly serve the cause of preserving the Punjabi language. People may they  are  only  used  to  speaking  and  listening  to  Punjabi,  not  to  reading  it.</p>
