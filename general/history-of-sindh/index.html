<p>Quotes from Essays On The History of Sindh by Mubarka Ali</p>

<p>However, in some cases. subject nations are so much integrated to the culture of their conquerors that they lose their national identity and align themselves with foreign culture. They accept their version of history and recognize the aggressors as their heroes who had liberated them from their inefficient rulers and, after elimination of their out-dated traditions, introduced them to  modem values and new ideas. Having these notions of foreign culture, they no longer take any interest in their history and traditions. They adopt a different point of view of history after rejecting the&rsquo;past and concentrate on the present and regard the arrival of conquerors as the harbinger of a new age.</p>

<p>Historians, after analyzing the Chuchnama, have reached the conclusion that it is a mixture of history and myth. Most of the terms that are used in it did not exist during the Arab rule, such as shahna that was used during the time of the Suljuq period. The term iqta started to be used during the Buide rule. Similarly, to sew criminal in the raw hide of an animal was the custom of the Mongols. So,  the whole story that Muhammad Bin Qasim was sewn up in rawhide as a punishment was not correct. He died as a disgraced person in prison (some historians believe that he committed suicide).</p>

<p>Muhammad bin Qasim disappeared in the history books. He was resurrected in the 1920s when communalism spread throughout India and history was also communalized.  The Muslims invented a history which provided them pride and strength to their identity. They started to call Sindh as &lsquo;Dar-us-Salam&rsquo; (entrance to Islam) and made Muhammad bin Qasim as the young hero who defeated the armies of the infidels and converted Sindh as a Muslim part of the Abbasid Empire.</p>

<p>Another significant aspect of the history of Sindh is that though it was ruled up to 1010-11 A.D. by Arabs, Sindh resisted adopting Arabic culture and language. When the Muslim ruling dynasties came to power in North India, Sindh followed the tradition and adopted Persian culture, with Persian becoming the court language. The immigrants from Central Asia and Iran strengthened  the culture of the ruling classes. However,  in spite of domination  of Persian culture,  common  people  retained  their  local  cultural traditions and continued to speak Sindhi.</p>
<p>(page 20)</p>
<p>the Arabs, who conquered Sindh, were fully aware of the Islamic teachings because they lived in the Islamic environment. On the other hand, the Turks, the Afghans and the Mughals who conquered North India were Muslims only by name. They were not well versed in Islamic  teachings  and,  therefore,  were  not  the  true representatives of Islam. Neither their administrative and ruling methods had anything to do with Islam.</p>
<p>(page 23)</p>
<p>G.M.  Saiyyid  introduced  some  very  important trends in the historiography  of Sindh. One of his arguments was that the Arab conquest ofSindh  was not a blessing for Sindh.  On the  contrary,  Muhammad  b. Qasim  was  an aggressor  like any other  who  plundered  and looted  the resources  of Sindh. To justify his arguments,  he used the same logic as was applied by Suleiman Nadvi regarding the Turks invaders. G.M. Saiyyid wrote that the Arabs in the 8th century and by coming of Umayyid  dynasty to power had lost the true Islamic spirit and became  mundane  and imperialist,  therefore, the Arab conquest had nothing to do with Islam.  It was an expansion of an Arab Empire which had  no  connection   with  Islam.   This  interpretation transformed  Muhammad  b.  Qasim  from  an aggressor to a hero and Raja Dahar, a defender of motherland,  who sacrificed his life in fighting rather than compromising  to the invaders.</p>
<p>(page 134)</p>
<p>Historians also give credit to Muhammad Bin Qasim for the conquest of Sindh and especially emphasise his youth as a factor for his achievements. The close study of the Chuchnama or Fathnama shows that, in reality, Muhammad Bin Qasim was just a figurehead and the real authority was in the hands of Hajjaj who conducted the whole expedition sitting in Basrah commanding the young general. We find that Muhammad Bin Qasim asked Hajjaj for everything: how to deal with the vanquished people, how to cross the river, how to talk with the tribal chiefs and how to make arrangements in the battlefields. He never dared to take any action independently. In this regard the decision of Hajjaj on the treatment of the Sindhi Hindus and Buddhists is very significant. When Muhammad Bin Qasim asked him how they should be treated, Hajjaj wrote to him that they should be treated as people of the book like the Zoroastrians of Persia and after paying jizya, they should be given the status of Zimmis. That was the model that later on the Sultans of Delhi and the Mughal Emperors adopted in India.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Arab conquest of Sindh is that in spite of the occupation and remaining a part of the Caliphate for 150 years, the Arabic language could not become the lingua franca.</p>
