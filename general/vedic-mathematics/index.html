  <p>I wondered about what is &ldquo;Vedic&rdquo; about &ldquo;Vedic Mathematics&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="book">Book</h2>
<p>Book Title: Vedic Mathematics
OR
Sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulae from the Vedas</p>
<p>Author:     Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati krsna Tirthaji Maharaja</p>
<p>Publisher:  Motilal Banarasidas Publishers
Bungalow Road, Jawahar Nagar, Delhi 110 007</p>
<pre><code>        ISBN: 81-208-0164-6 (Cloth)
        ISBN: 81-208-0164-4 (Paper)
</code></pre>
<p>The author says that these sutras can be found in an appendix of Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>His disciple Smt Manjula Devi says these are not to be found in the present rescensions of Atharvaveda .</p>
<p>The general editor redefines the meaning of Veda (using an excerpt from the author&rsquo;s preface) and asserts that the whole question is moot anyway.</p>
<p>The back cover says: &ldquo;The volume, more a &lsquo;magic&rsquo;, is the result of intuitional visualization of fundamental mathematical truths born after eight years of highly concentrated endeavour of .. (author).&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="excerpts-from-the-foreword">Excerpts from the Foreword</h2>
<p>(pages 5-6)</p>
<p>The question naturally arises as to whether the Sutras which form the
basis of this treatise exist anywhere in the Vedic literature as known
to us.  But this criticism loses all its force if we inform ourselves
of the definition of Veda given by Sri Sankaracharya himself as quoted
below: (Poster&rsquo;s note: this appears on page xiii).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very word &lsquo;Veda&rsquo; has this devotional meaning i.e. fountainhead
and illimitable store-house of all knowledge.  This derivation in effect,
means, connotes and implies that the Vedas SHOULD CONTAIN (italics by
the editor) within themselves all the knowledge needed by mankind
relating not only to the so called &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; (or other-worldly)
matters but also to those usually described as purely &lsquo;secular&rsquo;,
&rsquo;temporal&rsquo;, or &lsquo;worldly&rsquo; and also to the means required by humanity
as such for achievement of all-around, complete and perfect success
in all conceivable directions and that there can be no adjectival or
restricted epithet calculated (or tending) to limit that knowledge down
in any sphere, any direction or any respect whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, it connotes and implies that our ancient Indian lore
SHOULD BE (italics by the editor) all-around, complete, perfect and
able to throw fullest necessary light on all matters which any
aspiring seeker after knowledge can possibly seek to be enlightened
on.&quot;</p>
<p>It is the whole essence of his assessment of Vedic tradition that it
is not to be approached from a factual standpoint but from the ideal
standpoint viz, as the Vedas as traditionally accepted in India as
the repository of all knowledge should be and not what they are in
human posession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After winning the highest place in the B.A. examination, Shri
Venkatraman Saraswati appeared at the M.A. exam of the American College
of Sciences, Rochester, New York, from Bombay Center in 1903; and in 1904
at the age of just twenty he passed the M.A. Examination in further
seven subjects simultaneously securing the highest honours in all,
which is perhaps the all-time world-record of academic brilliance.<br>
His subjects included Sanskrit, Philosophy, English, Mathematics,
History and Science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a view to promote the cause of world peace and to spread the
lofty Vedantic spiritual ideas even outside India Shri Jagadguru
went on a tour to America in February, 1958, &hellip;. Jagadguruji stayed
there for about three months and during this period addressed rapt
audiences in hundreds of colleges of universities, churches and other
public institutions.  He was also invited to give talks and
mathematical demonstrations on the television.  In fact, he released
an exceptionally powerful current of moral and spiritual enlightenment
throughout America during his tour which proved a phenomenal success
comparable perhaps with that of Swami Vivekanand only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(page x)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously these formulae are not be found in the present recensions
of Atharwaveda; they were actually reconstructed, on the basis of
intuitive revelation, from materials here and there in Atharwaveda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>== Excerpts from the Author&rsquo;s Preface (pp xiv-xv)</p>
<p>(pages xiv-xv)</p>
<p>\8. And the contemptuous or, at best patronising attitude adopted by some
so-called Orientalists, Indologists, antiquarians, research-scholars
etc., who condemned, or light-heartedly, nay; irresponsibly, frivolously
and flippantly dismissed several abstruse-looking parts of the Vedas
as &ldquo;sheer nonsense&rdquo; &ndash; or as &ldquo;infant-humanity&rsquo;s prattle&rdquo;, and so on,
merely added fuel to the fire (so to speak) and further confirmed and
strengthened our resolute determination to unravel the too-long hidden
mysteries of philosophy and science contained in ancient India&rsquo;s Vedic
lore, with the consequence that, after eight years of concentrated
contemplation in forest-solitude, we were at long last able to recover
the long lost keys which alone could unlock the portals thereof.</p>
<p>\9. And we were agreeably astonished and intensely gratified to find that
the exceedingly tough mathematical problems (&hellip;) can be easily and
readily solved with the help of these ultra-easy Vedic sutras (..)
contained in the Parisista (the Appendix portion) of the Atharvaveda in
a few simple steps &hellip;.</p>
