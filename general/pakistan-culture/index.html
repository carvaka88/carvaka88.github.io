  <p>The following quotes describe &ldquo;Islamization&rdquo; of language and cultural practices in Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id="islamization-of-urdu">Islamization of Urdu</h2>

<p>Among the more than 4,000 words purged out were nain (eye), prem (love), mohan (dear one) etc.</p>

<p>Zia&rsquo;s understanding of national cohesion was that Islam was the binding force of the Pakistani nation.  He thus advocated the promotion of Arabic and Urdu as a means of overcoming provincial and &ldquo;centrifugal&rdquo; forces &hellip;.</p>
<p>... in 1984 &hellip; the state began broadcasting news in Arabic on Television</p>
<p>The Arabic news broadcasts are supplemented by daytime nationwide broadcasts of Arabic language learning and Quranic text learning.</p>
<p>(page 44)</p>
<p>In terms of sheer numbers, Bengali had a clear claim.  In terms of idelogical proximity to Islam, Sindhi has a higher proportion of Arabic words ..</p>
<p>Those agitating for its (Bengali) implememtation as a national language were under suspicion as Indian state - for what good Muslim would abjure Urdu for Bengali?</p>
<p>(page 45)</p>
<p>When General Ayub Khan declared martial law in October 1958, he proclaimed - in accordance with his modernist sensibility - in Decement 1958 that all languages of Pakistan ought to shift to using a roman script (Turkish).  .. Ayub&rsquo;s plan was never implemented.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Further, despite Bengali&rsquo;s constitutional status as a national lanugage, it continued to be viewed as a suspect &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; languare, particularly used in forms of cultural expression not Islamic in origin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Monem Khan as Governor of East Bengal (sic) banned the songs of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore from being played on Radio Pakistan in 1966.  He did this using the charge that Bengali was a &ldquo;non-Muslim&rdquo; language and a carrier of &ldquo;cultural domination&rdquo; by Calcutta &hellip;</p>

<p>Virtually all obsrvers attribute the Zia regime with the inauguratino of an epistemic shift in national consciousness in Pakistan, through extensive efforts to Islamize the state.</p>
<p>(page 194)</p>
<p>Most importantly, the broadcasts were in English.  As with all Jinnah&rsquo;s
speeches, and as with Iqbal&rsquo;s 1930 address to the All-India Muslim League,
so too was this one in English.</p>
<h2 id="basant-in-pakistan">Basant in Pakistan</h2>
<p>Celebration of Basant became controversial in Pakistan.</p>

<p>A new twist was added to their protest this year when some members of the hardline Muslim Jamaat-e-Islami party declared that the festival was initiated in the memory of a Hindu who was hanged for blaspheming against the Muslim prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-death-of-the-secular-festival/">http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-death-of-the-secular-festival/</a></strong></p>
<p>Banned by inept governments to please religious extremists, a corrupt police department and bigoted nationalists, Basant remains vividly alive in literature, poetry, art and, of course, the city of Lahore’s collective memory.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There are a few, mostly weak and historically suspect accounts that portray the festival, incorrectly, as a Hindu celebration that is against Islam. Indeed a very large number of essays, newspaper articles and books have been written propagating the patently false belief, declaring the celebration of Basant an act of blasphemy and equating it with kufr (apostasy).</p>
<p>The story of Haqiqat Rai Baghmal Puri, often told, both in India and in Pakistan, in the context of basant, has long been used to perpetuate hateful myths related to the festival. The truth is rather simple and unremarkable. Haqiqat Rai was the only son of a Khatri (a mostly Hindu and Sikh caste) in Sialkot, Punjab, in the first half of the eighteenth century. One day, a few of his schoolmates made fun of his religion and the young man retorted by making disrespectful statements about the daughter Fatimah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The young man was tried in the court of the local qazi (Muslim judge) who decided that, while it was alright to make fun of Hinduism, a response to the provocation constituted blasphemy. The boy was sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out, incidentally, on the day of the Basant festival in Lahore. A tomb was built in memory of the Hindu boy and people, mostly Hindu and Sikh, started gathering at the place each year to commemorate his death. It was not for about another hundred and fifty years that a connection was proposed between Basant and the annual commemoration of Haqiqat Rai’s death.</p>

<p>In the last decade, the ‘origin’ of the festival again became a bone of contention. Some said that since the festival had Hindu connections (with the goddess Saraswati), it could not be celebrated by Muslims. Others linked it to Sikhism and the supposed anti-Muslim nature of the event. Still others, poor liberals, began to argue that, in fact, Basant was a Muslim festival.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hindus are clumsy as regards dress before the advent of Muslims in the region.  They used to cover their bodies with one or two cloth sheets.  Muslims introduced the dress, which covered the body properly and looked good.  (Pakistan Studies for Intermediate Classes, Punjab Textbook Board 1985).</p>
<h2 id="indian-classical-dance">Indian Classical Dance</h2>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="http://mattersindia.com/2016/05/art-not-sex-pakistans-dancers-take-a-stand/">http://mattersindia.com/2016/05/art-not-sex-pakistans-dancers-take-a-stand/</a></strong></p>
<p>Dance was banned in 1981 as part of an Islamisation drive led by military ruler Zia-ul-Haq.  His directive specifically targeted dancers wearing ankle bells, an essential accessory of the main classical forms which the regime associated with obscenity and nudity.</p>
<p>That reluctance is amplified by Pakistani classical dance’s shared lineage with India.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been desperate to distinguish itself from its neighbour and arch-rival since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.</p>
<p>But Odissi and bharatanatyam are historically linked to Hinduism, and many Pakistani dancers complete their training in India due to the lack of facilities back home.</p>
<p>“(By) creating an identity which had nothing to do with our Indian past, we gave up on dance, music, theatre,” says Kirmani, known as a “guru” in her own right.</p>
<p>“But what identity can Pakistan create in just a few years, if it denigrates all common past?” she added.</p>
<p>“There is no Hindu or Muslim dance, dance is dance,” adds Suhaee Abro, a former student of Kirmani.</p>
<p>One form that has gained a sort of official recognition is kathak, with its dazzling and noisy footwork akin to flamenco, and dancers whirling like dervishes.</p>
<p>This indulgence derives from the fact that it was practised in the Muslim court of the Mughals.</p>

<p>A culture policy drafted by the National Commission on History and Culture stated:
&ldquo;A comprehensive history of Pakistani culture will be undertaken by the National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research, highlighting the indigenous culture of Pakistan as well as the impact of Arab, Iranian, Central Asian and Western cultures&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is a conscious bid to avoid any mention of Indian or Hindu influences. Officially, our society is to be protected from the Indian- or Hindu- influences. In reality, the lives of our ordinary people are inundated with the popular culture of India as expressed in their movies and pop music.</p>
<p>In its search for a cultural identity as apart from the cultural identity of India, Pakistan has looked upon the art of dancing with suspicion. It has continuously been claimed by the official authorities that dance is not part of Pakistani culture. The reason for this being that dance has always been an essential and integral part of Indian life and culture, and Pakistan felt that they must have a separate and a &ldquo;New&rdquo; culture.</p>
<p>He disbanded the Arts Councils and the National Performing Arts Group and Dance Company and implicitly termed them &ldquo;un-Islamic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>.&hellip;</p>
<p>The very first programme that was banned on PTV by General Zia ul Haq was &ldquo;Payal,&rdquo; a dance programme. Since then dancing by women remains taboo. Zia also banned devotional dancing at religious processions and on occasions of Urs at shrines.</p>

<p>The authors of these textbooks further mark the differences in dress, food, rituals, ceremonies and festivals. One author goes to the extent that he has even classified trees and animals as Hindu and Muslim. According to him, the peepal and burgad (banyan) are Hindu trees, while the date and olive are Muslim trees! Not just that but he rendered the cow a Hindu, while the camel and horse as Muslim.</p>
