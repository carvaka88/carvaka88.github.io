  <p>Trautmann came across a stone inscription in Sanskrit near the entryway of the Old Indian Institute Building at Oxford.  From viewing this, the special character of British concept of Aryan came to him as an epiphany. (page 3)</p>
<p><strong>Aryans and British India, Thomas R. Trautmann, ISBN 0-520-20546-4, Call number DS425.T68 1997, University of California Press.</strong></p>
<p>The overwhelmingly dark face of slavery over last thousand years in Europe and Middle East led to a belief of that dark-skin means less civilized.  India presented an enigma, a land populated by civilized people who are dark skinned.  Andalusi, an Islamic writer from eleventh century says that the Indians were the first nation to have cultivated the sciences, and that though they were black, Allah ranked them above many white and brown people.  At the end of the last century, consensus developed around what Trautmann calls racial theory of Indian civilization: that the Indian civilization is a product of clash and mixing of light skinned Aryan invaders and dark-skinned barbaric Dravidians.  Trautmann calls this theory the crabgrass of Indian history, which has been so far immune to new information and he would like to uproot it.</p>
<p>Trautmann says his study lies within the territory first explored by Bernard Cohn, who called it colonial sociology of India.  He focuses on British Sanskritists who he believes provided theoretical structures and directed the construction of ethnologies of India.</p>
<p>Trautmann says that Edward Said&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo; (1978), although focuses only on French/British and Arabs, has had a dramatic impact on Indianist scholars.  Said&rsquo;s argument is an extension to Michel Focault&rsquo;s concept of power/knowledge: that power and knowledge implicate each other.  The author believes that Said&rsquo;s book has created a sense that &ldquo;all academic knowledge about India .. is somehow tinged and impressed with, violated by gross political fact.&rdquo;  To Said, Orientalism is not merely the intellectual product of Orientalists but &ldquo;a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having an authority over it.&rdquo; Trautmann says that to make Said&rsquo;s book useful for India, a double translation is needed: from the Middle East to South Asia and from polemic to analysis.</p>
<p>To help clarify different Orientalists and their positions, Trautmann defines Orientalism(1) as knowledge produced by Orientalists, scholars who knew Asian languages, and Orientalism(2) as European representations of the Orient not necessararily by Orientalists.  James Mill and G.W.F Hegel, who never set foot in India and knew no Indian languages, are leading architects of O(2).  O(2) is a parasitic of and frequently in opposition to O(1).  Trautmann finds Said&rsquo;s idea of Orientalism as monument-of-colonialism unsatisfactory and seems to believe that it is possible to examine the substance of Orientalism without justifying colonialism.  Continuous reassessment of this body of work (O(1)) is unavoidable because any view of India is built on and will continue to build in part on the work by Orientalists.</p>
<p>In this book, Trautmann focusses on O(1), specifically on British Sanskritists.  Orientalist study of India is British in origin, it languished in Britain in later years and was taken up on the Continent, especially by German scholars.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-mosaic-ethnology-of-asiatick-jones">Chapter 2: The Mosaic Ethnology of Asiatick Jones</h2>
<p>William Jones founded the Asiatic Society in 1784 and gave an institutional
form to British scholar-adminstrators and for the most part assumed
the authority over the older Orientalism.  The earlier writings by
travelers and missionaries, mostly translations from Persian and considered
authoritative until then were soon eclipsed.  The new Orientalism drew
authority from its knowledge of Indian languages as compared to eye-witness
accounts of travelers and missionaries.</p>
<p>Trautmann argues that Jones&rsquo;s proposal of the Indo-European language family
can be better understood if we recognize that Jones&rsquo;s project was
primarily ethnological and not linguistic.  The biblical story of Noah
in the book of Genesis provided the framework for this Mosaic ethnology.
(the book of Genesis is attributed to Moses). Two of his sources were
ethnological writings by Jacob Bryant and Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>Mosaic ethnology is not an eighteenth century invention but is the common
heritage of peoples of the book, Jews, Christians and Muslims.  It was
common place in Muslim histories that Indians were descendents of Ham
(son of Noah) and they considered Indians as the first one of the seven
ancients nations to have cultivated the sciences.</p>
<p>The whole ethnological story had to be contained within the time frame
constructed Archbishop by Ussher.  According to Archbishop Ussher
God created the world in 4004 B.C. and the flood of Noah took place in
2349 B.C.  Jones rejected the ancient Indian doctrine of immense cycles of
time repeating endlessly and considered the flood narrative in Puranas as
independent confirmation of the flood.  Jones&rsquo;s reading of Indian chronology
is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>   Adam         Manu I                    Krta yuga        4004 B.C.
   Noah         Many II                                    2948 B.C.
   The Flood    fish, tortoise and boar                    2349 B.C.
                avatars 
   Nimrod       Narsimha avatar           Treta yuga       2217 B.C.
   Bel          Bali avatar                                2105 B.C.
   Raamah       Rama avatar               Dvapara yuga     2028 B.C.
                Buddha avatar             Kali yuga        1026 B.C.
</code></pre><p>To Jones, Christianity was the only true religion and Europe&rsquo;s talents
surpassed those of Asia.  Three faculties of mind: memory, reason and
imagination were same everywhere; Asiatics excelled in imagination but
reason and taste were grand prerogatives of European mind.  In Science,
asiatics were &ldquo;mere children.&rdquo;  The great scientific accomplishment of
India lay in past, and the study of Indian science was a contribution to
history and not to current science.  The British orientalists and their
antagonists on the continent agreed in rejection of Indian time and
superiority of European science.  In cultivating astronomy and and art
of navigation Hamians or Indians promoted the first beginnings of
civilization, while in idolatory they had first departed from the pure
original religion of Noah.  Jones tends to identify teachings of Veda
with a primitive monotheism.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-british-indomania">Chapter 3: British Indomania</h2>
<p>In the early years after British conquest of Bengal, everything about India
had an aspect of novelty which explains the initial enthusiasm.  Indophobia
which followed early Indomania was a predictable face of colonialism.  The
author argues that Indophobia was made and not born.</p>
<p>Indomania was an enthusiam for India entertained by a few well educated
Britons, whose visibility caused a certain resonance among the elite.  It
never sent down deep roots in the British social system.  Indomania was
exclusively directed towards Hindus and not Muslims, it was primarily
concerned with ancient Indian civilization before the arrival of Muslims.</p>
<p>In early writings Hinduism was generally portrayed in favorable terms.  The
two main features were: that Hinduism is basically monotheistic, and that
the benevolence of its religion and laws made India prosperous and peaceful
country before foreign conquests.  Idolatory or use of images was explained
as a lapse and a secondory feature and not the essence.</p>
<p>[Poster&rsquo;s note: Al-Biruni, 11 the century Muslim scholar who visited India
wrote similar things]</p>
<p>Hinduism was thought of as the religion of the native Indians and Muslims
were regarded as foreign conquerors.  Indigenous Muslims were rarely
recognized and mostly ignored.  Most of the evils of India were attributed
to Muslim conquest and despotic rule.  The British government was considered
as enfranchisement of Hindus.</p>
<p>Exposure to Hinduism had an unsettling effect upon the Christian belief
among the English in Calcutta.  The author cites (in a footnote) an example
from Hastings&rsquo; diaries where he wonders &ldquo;Is the incarnation of Christ more
intelligible than .. those of Bishen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first wave or Orientalism often tested the limits of reason in the
construction of favorable reading of Hinduism.  William Jones&rsquo; project
of Mosaic ethnology appears to make new Orientalism safe for Anglicans.
He rejected the long cycles of Indian time but accepted the flood narrative
of the Puranas as independent confirmation of the Biblical flood.  He in
effect guaranteed that the new admiration of Hinduims reinforced Christianity
and and not work against it.</p>
<p>Indomania and Egyptomania ran hand in hand until decipherment of Egyptian
hieorglyphics.  The idea of supposed connection between Egypt and India
died after the decipherment.</p>
<p>British enthusiasm for Indian astronomy began with a paper read by
John Playfair in 1789 before the Royal Academy of Edinburgh.  However,
European enthusiasm was created by French and not British.  It waned
after 1809.</p>
<p>Francis Wilford, office in the army of East India Company, devoted his
time to studyding geographical sections of the Puranas.  He sought help
from a pandit in reading Puranas and extracting information.  The pandit
was given money to hire assistants and was also given a place in a college
in Benares as an encouragement.  The pandit presumably pocketed the money,
composed 12000 brand new Sanskrit slokas (verses) and inserted them into
Skanda, Bramhanda and Padma Puranas.  It took sometime to discover this
fraud.  One insertion in Padma Purana, in nine verses recounted the story
of Noah, his three sons, and the curse of Ham.</p>
<p>British enthusiasts of India include talented individuals such as Jones
and Colebrook and rank amateurs.  The discourse of Indomania was a mixture
of pearls and dung.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-british-indophobia">Chapter 4: British Indophobia</h2>
<p>The author begins this chapter with: &ldquo;British Indomania did not die of
natural causes; it was killed off.&rdquo;  In rest of the chapter he tries to
build a case for this statement.</p>
<p>The Indophobia was constructed by Evangelicalism and Utiliarinism and
its chief architects were Charles Grant and James Mill.</p>
<p>Charles Grant, an evangelical, after returning from India wrote a policy
paper &ldquo;The Observations on the .. Asiatic subjects of Great Britain.&rdquo;  He attacks Hinduism, Indian civilization and prevailing Indomania and
makes a case for aggressive Anglicization and Christianization.  In this
paper (immensly influential in author&rsquo;s opinion) he invented the reform
agenda for British India and thus created a justification for British rule.</p>
<p>Grant judged Indians (specifically Bengali Hindus) as lacking in truth,
honesty, and good faith.  He claims to be interested not in blanket
condemnation of Indians but in determining &ldquo;their true place in the
moral scale.&rdquo;  Grant develops an argument that the moral depravity of
Hindus results from government, laws, religion &ndash; in short, from moral
causes and consequently the cure must of the same kind.  Although he uses
Jones&rsquo; discourse to build his case, he completely ignores Jonesean doctrine
of a kinship between European languages and Sanskrit, and hence between
Europeans and Indians.</p>
<p>Thomas Macaulay, who studied neither Sanskrit nor Arabic, regards these
as repositories of outmoded knowledge and states his belief that English is
to be to India what Greek and Latin had been to England.  This was in
direct opposition to Orientalists who considered Sanskrit to be Greek and
Latin of India.  The author considers Macaulay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Minute&rdquo; to be a masterpiece
of polemical prose.</p>
<p>Charles Grant was influential in setting East India College in England.
One of the principal motive was to innoculate British boys with European
culture against Indian culture.  Ironically it was Indophobia that created
the professorship of Sanskrit at the East India College, the principal
reason being rivalry with the French.</p>
<p>The Anglicist postition prevailed and drove the British policy down the
path of minimization and denigration of accomplishment of Indian
civilization.</p>
<p>James Mill&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of British India (1817)&rdquo;, most particularly the long
essay &ldquo;Of the Hindus,&rdquo; is the single most important source of British
Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism.  The author says it can be
considered a secular version of Grant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Observations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mill&rsquo;s attack upon Orientalism begins with the question of authority,
the issue of greatest vulnerability for him.  Mill knew no India languages
and had never been to India.  He consigns Orientalists and India hands
who knew Indian languages to merely gatherer of facts and eyewitnesses
and reserves the right of philosophizing, forming theories to people
like himself who presumably have higher level mental faculties.  Mill
who read Jones&rsquo; discourse is completely silent about Jonesean doctrine
of a kinship between Greek, Latin and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Until beginning of 19th century, the purpose of British empire in
India was no more than yielding profits to shareholders of the East India
Company.  Grant proposed a nobler purpose, the moral uplift of the Indians.
Mill promoted the civilization project of liberating Indians from their
own past.  Systematic denigration of Indians and Indian civlization and
resulting Indophobia was a price for development of justifications for
British rule.</p>
<p>The author closes the chapter with this paragraph: &ldquo;&hellip; Indophobia did not
spring up naturally from the soild of Britain, it was deliberately
built. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-philology-and-ethnology">Chapter 5: Philology and Ethnology</h2>
<p>In the early nineteenth century, names &ldquo;Comparative philology&rdquo; and &ldquo;ethnology&rdquo;
gained currency and were generally thought of as closely related to each
other.</p>
<p>Although the role played by study of Sanskrit in the formation of comparative
philology is well-known, its role in formation of ethnology is forgotten,
mostly because of the subsequent split between in ethnology and linguistics.</p>
<p>James Cowell Prichard naturalized the name &ldquo;ethnology&rdquo; in Britain.  His
methodology, which prevailed for the first half of nineteenth century, was
essentially classification of people based upon the classfication of
languages which in turn used methods of comparative philology.  Although the
study of physical features was pursued, it was subordinate to linguistic
study and assumed to produce congruent results.</p>
<p>For couple of decades after the formation of Asiatic Society, the new
Orientalism rested upon a collaboration between Indian teachers and British
orientalists.  During this time, the new Orientalism remained a British
monopoly.  The pandits were the keepers of the most advanced linguistic
science to that time, Vyakarana or Sanskrit grammar.  Two elements of
Indian grammatical science entered the British ethnology: the unity of
of all languages as corruptions of eternal and incorruptible Sanskrit,
and the analysis of the vocabularies of modern languages of India
(Sanskrit, foreign and local).</p>
<p>The monopoly of the Asiatic Society did not last long, and Orientalist
institutions were soon established elsewhere in India and in Europe.
Alexander Hamilton, the first Sanskrit professor in Britain at East India
College played a pivotal role in the transmission of the knowledge of
Sanskrit to the Continent.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapter describes the early 19 th century British belief
of the linguistic and ethnological unity of Indian languages.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-race-science-versus-sanskrit">Chapter 6: Race Science versus Sanskrit</h2>
<p>Friedrich Max Muller was the creator of the notion of the Aryan race and
ardently advocated a kinship between Indian and Europeans.  (It is
interesting to note that he lost out to Monier Monier-Williams in
competition for Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, which was privately
endowed for promoting Christianity by translating the Bible into Sanskrit).</p>
