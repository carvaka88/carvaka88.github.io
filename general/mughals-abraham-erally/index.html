  <h1>Abraham Erally: The Mughal World</h1>

  
  
  
  

  <p>Abraham Erally was an Indian writer of history.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(page xiii)</p>
<p>The fight of son against father, and of brother against brother, over the throne was the norm among the Mughals, - Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Shahjehan and Aurangzeb had all fought fratricidal wars, and most of the emperors had to face rebellions by their sons as well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Shahjehan prohibited the Muslims from changing their religion.  He also directed that Hindus should dress differently than Muslims - while Muslims tied the tunic on the right-hand side, Hindus were required to tie it on the left.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Aurangzeb never once visited him (Shahjehan), not even during his final illness, and did not attend his funeral.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(page 22)</p>
<p>The people of one part of the subcontient hardly knew those of the other parts, and had little in common with them.  They spoke different languages, had different social systesm.  Only in the thin upper crust of society, among the brahmin and the Persianized Muslim aristocracy, were there any pan-Indian linkages.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>... the productive class was overwhelmingly Hindu, while the leisure class was predominantly Muslim (the leisure class was the ruling class &hellip; not economically productive or even supportive of production)&hellip; Rajputs and other local chieftains were merely admitted to the (ruling) class as a matter of administrative, military or military expediency.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In Mughal India, or indeed the whole eastern Muslim world, had a natural aristocracy, they were Persians.  Everyone looked up to Persians, and Persians looked down on everyone.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Persians often sneered at Mughals and Indians as semi-barbarians; they snickered at the Indian efforts to speak and write Persian, and rediculed Indian imitations of Persian courtly manners as vulgar (similar to British would mock Anglicized Indians)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In contrast to Persian, Afghans, whom the Mughals overthrew from power .., were seen as crude and vulgar people, without manners, gluttons and drunkards.</p>
<p>North &ndash; Sunni, India-born Muslims and Hindu converts were held in low esteem and were denied any major role in government.  Preferred language was Persian</p>
<p>In Southm Shias and native Muslims held high positions, along with Afghans, Ethiopians and a few Persians.  Preferred lanugage was Dakhine.  Muslims contributed only a small percentage of population, greater number of Hindus were employed in High positions.</p>
<p>(page 26)</p>
<p>Infidel-bashing was a more a matter of literary overkill than of physical excess.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Besides, for the common people, who were brutally exploited by their own rulers, the establishment of Muslm rule meant merely the substitution of one predator by another, which did not significantly alter the quality of their lives.</p>
<p>... Muslims in India were largely urban people, while most Hindus lived in villages.</p>
<p>... temple domolitions were a part of their victory rite rather than a specifically religious act.  Though Muslim rulers often termed their wars against Hindu kins as jihad, this was done more as a matter of conventions than as a deliberate policy: their objective was political than religious.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>By the time the Turks invaded India, the religious fervour of Islam had largely disssipated - the motive for their conquest was essentially political, not religious - and this had a moderating influence on Muslim theocracy in India.</p>
<p>(page 33)</p>
<p>... the future belonged to brahmins, who, despite their numerous sectarian and lineage divisions, were the only distinctive all-India community.</p>
<p>(page 34)</p>
<p>the (brahmin) community was in general on the decline in Mughal India. It was only with the establishment of the Maratha kingdom that brahmins finally began to rehabilitate themselves, achieving a position of political prominence, which they would further expand and consolidate under the British, by both serving and battling the new empire.</p>
<p>(page 38)</p>
<p>But then, Indians had no great regard for Europeans either. While Europeans saw themselves as major players in India, the Mughals regarded them as minor curiosities. Thus while Sir Thomas Roe, the British ambassador, and Captain Hawkins, the presumed ambassador, claimed intimacy with Jahangir, and their journals are full of lore about their relationships with the emperor, there is not even a passing word about either of them in the 745-page long (in English translation) memoirs of Jahangir, though the visits of Persian ambassadors are described in detail, and even the missions from petty Central Asian potentates are noted.  European powers did not amount to much in Mughal estimation.</p>
<p>(page 65)</p>
<p>Even drininkg water was a major item of expense in the royal household, for Mughal emperors were fastidious about water, and normally drank only water from the Ganga, which had to be brought from a considerable distance. According to Abul Fazl, &lsquo;both at home and on travels he (Akbar) drinks Ganga water brought in sealed jars from the river] &hellip; For the cooking of food, rain water or water taken from the Yamuna and Chenab is used, mixed with a little Ganga water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(page 69)</p>
<p>Babur, Humayun and Jahangir were heavy drinkers, Akbar less so, but Shah Jahan, whose weakness was for aphrodisiacs, was temperate, and Aurangzeb, who rigorously abided by the law, abstemious.</p>
<p>(page 70)</p>
<p>The custom of celebrating Nauruz on a grand scale was begun by Akbar.</p>
<p>(page 83)</p>
<p>Sycophancy was a part of the Persian court culture that the Mughals adopted, but in India it over-ripened and putrefied.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But while they bowed and scraped before the emperor, they expected nothing less for themselves from their own subordinates.</p>
<p>(page 100)</p>
<p>Whatever the amir did, the decision would have been made on the advice of astrologers, who were omnipresent in Mughal society and were major initiators of action in every sphere of Mughal life. The higher the person, the graver the issues, the greater the role of astrologers. Royal astrologers were highly paid professionals. From the rationalist Akbar to the cynical and saturnine Aurangzeb, the Mughal emperors were all firm believers in astrology, and so were the Mughal amirs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Taboo-ridden Hindus would of course have nothing to do with Europeans. &lsquo;As they hold the Farangis to be vile and abominable,&rsquo; says Manucci, &rsquo;they have persuaded themselves that that people have no polite manners, that they are ignorant, wanting in ordered life, and very dirty.  For these things they would sooner die unaided than drink a cup of water from the hand of a Farangi; nor would they eat anything that he has prepared. They believe such an act to be an irremediable disgrace, and a sin for which there is no remission . . . They state openly that a man of low birth is as despicable as is a Farangi )</p>
<p>(page 120)</p>
<p>Homosexuality, though prevalent among the Mughal amirs, seems to have been rare among the common people in India. Hindus were largely untouched by the vice — they, according to Albiruni, considered it as revolting as eating beef.</p>
<p>(page 125)</p>
<p>Traditionally, there was no purdah (seclusion and veiling of women) in India, till the Rajputs adopted the custom in imitation of Muslim aristocracy. Purdah then became a status symbol among Hindus, but only among the ruling classes, and even among them it was not enforced as rigorously as among Muslims.</p>
<p>(page 150)</p>
<p>Akbar&rsquo;s foster brother Mirza Aziz had a droll explanation as to why a man needed four wives: &lsquo;A man must marry one woman of Hindustan to rear up children; one wife from Khurasan to do the household work; one woman from Iran to keep company and talk.&rsquo; And the fourth?  &lsquo;Why? One woman from Transoxiana to whip the other three and keep peace!&rsquo; Aziz cracked.</p>
<p>(page 222)</p>
<p>For the people, it made little difference whether they were ruled by Turks or Afghans, by Mughals, Rajputs or Marathas. They were all rapacious. Being ruled by Hindu kings was not necessarily a blessing for Hindus. As the Jesuits noted about the Bijapuri occupation of Thanjavur, &lsquo;The people have submitted to the yoke of a conqueror from whom they get less cruelty and more justice than from their own sovereigns.&rsquo; It was only the benevolent efficiency of individual rulers like Sher Shah or Akbar that gave the people respite from oppression.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This was because the interpretation of Islamic law varied greatly, and the king could always find some conniving jurist to validate his decisions. Virtually, therefore, the will of the emperor was the law. &lsquo;As regards the laws,&rsquo; says Pelsaert, &rsquo;they are scarcely observed at all, for the administration is absolutely autocratic&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the Arab empire expanded into the lands of other established religions, it became impossible to enforce the death-or-Islam rule, as infidels in the new territories were too firm in their own faith to accept Islam, and too numerous to be killed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There was therefore never any frenzied general destruction of temples by sultans in India, nor any wanton slaughter of Hindus, even in the worst of times. It was, however, common to demolish the chief temple of a captured city and erect a mosque on its site, to demonstrate that the victor had triumphed not only over the enemy&rsquo;s army, but over the enemy&rsquo;s gods as well. To destroy Hindu temples was to prove the powerlessness of Hindu gods — it was the medieval equivalent of capturing the enemy&rsquo;s standard. Similarly, though Muslim rulers setting out against an infidel or heretic kingdom habitually spoke of their campaign as a holy war, it was often just a convenient fig-leaf to cover the shame of naked aggression. The pursuit of power, not the propagation of faith, was the motive force of military and political action by Muslim rulers in India, even by Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>In 1562, Akbar banned the forced conversion of prisoners to Islam, and followed it with the abolition of the pilgrim tax and jizya. Further, he permitted re-conversions from Islam to Hinduism, allowed Hindu girls forcibly married to Muslims to be restored to their parents, repealed the death penalty for blasphemy, and sought to modify Muslim and Hindu personal laws through various decrees.</p>
<p>On the whole, there was much more religious freedom in India than in contemporary Europe (with its inquisition, religious massacres and witch-hunts) or in any Muslim state outside India.</p>
<p>(page 227)</p>
<p>Thomas Coryat, the British eccentric who publicly blasphemed Prophet Muhammad in India: if I had spoken thus much in Turkey or Persia against Mahomet, they would have rested me upon a spitt.&rsquo; Says Terry: &lsquo;All religions are tolerated, and their priests held in good esteeme.&rsquo; It was only in contrast to the passivity and broad tolerance of Hinduism that Islam seemed virulent.</p>
<p>In any case, the bulk of India&rsquo;s population was little affected by theocracy, as most of its disabilities, except jizya, were directed against the Hindu ruling classes. Even Aurangzeb&rsquo;s temple demolitions did not greatly affect the common people, because the demolitions were largely confined to urban centres — in the rural areas, where the vast majority of Hindus lived, there were no great temples to be demolished, only small shrines, and there were hardly any Muslims around to do the demolition either. What hit the common people, and hit them hard in the stomach, where it hurt them most, was the imposition of jizya.</p>
<p>Jahangir acted on that precept, blinding and imprisoning one rebel son (Khusrav) and driving another (Shah Jahan) into exile; Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb cold-bloodedly exterminated their brothers, cousins and nephews, and even Akbar found it necessary to execute his cousin Abul Kasim, Kamran&rsquo;s son. &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; says Shah Jahan&rsquo;s chronicler Muhammad Salih Kambu, &rsquo;entirely lawful for the great sovereigns to rid this mortal world of the existence of their brothers and other relations, whose annihilation is conducive to the common good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>From the point of view of the common people, the one great advantage
of the medieval government was that it did not have the capacity to
routinely intrude into their lives, especially in rural India. In everyday
matters, the local bodies — the village or caste or guild council-
administered justice according to their customs and practices, as they
had been doing for centuries, caring for the welfare of the individuals in</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(page 260)</p>
<p>But while the shariah was immutable, life was not. So shariah had to be interpreted by jurists (Mujatahids) to apply it to emergent situations, and since there were nearly as many interpretations as there were jurists, monarchs had considerable freedom in deciding what was right and wrong.  Thus when it turned out that Akbar had taken far more wives than custom permitted, willing jurists reinterpreted the rules to validate the extra marriages. And when some Kazis refused to legitimize Aurangzeb&rsquo;s usurpation, the prince was able to persuade jurist Abdul Wahab to declare that, since Shah Jahan was physically unfit to govern, the throne could be deemed as vacant and therefore it was legal for Aurangzeb to occupy it.  For that peerless exposition, the emperor made Abdul Wahab the Chief Kazi of the empire, who then went on to acquire an appropriately peerless reputation for corruption. Another time, to conform to Aurangzeb&rsquo;s will, judicial officers sanctioned the execution of Muslim and Hindu prisoners captured during the siege of Satara, revising their earlier judgement against execution.</p>
