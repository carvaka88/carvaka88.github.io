AlaudDin Khilji&rsquo;s 18-year-old son Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah Khilji was the last Khilji ruled for 4 years and was killed by Khusro Khan, one of AlaudDin&rsquo;s generals.  After few months Khusro was killed by Ghazi Malik, later to be called Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq.  He had a Turkic father and a Hindu mother.)</p>

The influence of the Turkish dialects declined during Mughal period especially during Akbar&rsquo;s rule.  In Abul Fazl&rsquo;s inventory of book, no Turkish books are found.  None of the avaiable histories record Akbar speaking in Turkish language.</p>
<p>Medieval Sanskrit inscriptions identified the Turkic invaders by their linguistic or ethnic affiliaion (Turushka) rather than religious identity (Muslims).</p>
<h2 id="urduhindi-in-india">Urdu/Hindi in India</h2>

<p>Among them were Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. Arabic, as the language of religion and of law, was cultivated by the learned, but its sphere was limited. Turkish might be spoken within the domestic walls, but it did not possess any considerable literature. Its influence was small.  Persian was the language of the court. It was used not only as an official language for all state purposes; it was the medium of social intercourse, and it was the favorite of kings and princes, of officers and soldiers, merchants and mendicants.</p>
<p>While it may be difficult to assess the contribution of India to Arabic literature, it is easy, with the help of the anthologies (tazkiras), to compile a goodly study of the considerable output of Persian literature from Indian pens. But inevitably the Persian literature of India has been dominated by the standards set by the Persians; and although in language, style, and content the Persian literature of India bears the indubitable impress of its land of origin, and there is little doubt regarding its high quality, it cannot be claimed that this literature is redolent of the native soil, or that it adequately enshrines the genius and spirit of the Indian people.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>From this period—that is, the end of the 14th century—this language, which may be called Hindustani, continues to progress rapidly. When Aurangzeb began the conquest of Bijapur and Golkonda in the 17th century, the poets of the Deccan began to visit the North, and the consequence was that Hindustani poetry became known to the writers of Delhi and other places. The return of the prodigal to the paternal home led to a new development. The courtiers of the Emperors of Delhi were mainly speakers and writers of Persian, but the Hindustani which came to them from the Deccan was the true representative of the mixture of Hindu-Muslim culture which prevailed among the peoples of India.</p>
<p>They found it rather uncouth for their tastes, and in their misguided zeal started to reform and, according to their judgment, purify it. Thus non-Persian sounds were regarded by them as harsh and heavy, and they began to abandon all the words containing such sounds. Again, the Hindustani of the Deccan was the language originally of the ordinary common people, which the Sufis had adopted for the reason that it was popular. It contained many expressions which struck the ears of the aristocratic courtiers as vulgar.</p>
<p>Thus the language was shorn of a great deal of its naturalness, and the growing degeneracy and demoralization of the Mughal court favored the development of an artificial language and literature. During the 18th century, Hindustani was transformed into Urdu-i-Mualla. The patronage of the high and the mighty increased the number of its votaries. Unfortunately, in the sequel it suffered from this change. Although it became the language of both Hindu and Muslim upper classes, its contact with the common people was weakened. At the end of the 18th century, the Mughal Empire broke down. The British seized power, and they began the search for a language which could be used for popular purposes. At Fort William College, Calcutta, which was established to teach British officers Indian languages besides other subjects, a number of them were taken up for study.</p>
<h2 id="urdu-script-naskh-and-nastaliq">Urdu Script: Naskh and Nastaliq</h2>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90#.5m3fzhna8">https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90#.5m3fzhna8</a></strong></p>
<p>... However, what is true is that Urdu is intrinsically connected to the “Pakistan” side of my Pakistani-American identity and I have every intention of fighting for its preservation.</p>
<p>There is also a political dimension for opting for the traditional nastaliq. In short, naskh carries an “Arab” connotation because it is the preferred script for the Arabic language (ironically invented by a Persian). Due to recent geo-politics, such as the enthronement of the Saudi backed Wahhabi dictator Zia ul Haq in 1980&rsquo;s Pakistan, as well as the politicization of the history of Arab imperialism over India, Arab intrusion in South Asian matters is always contested. One of the quickest ways to create an argument among Pakistanis is for one person to say the Arabic “Allah Hafiz” for goodbye instead of the Urdu “Khuda Hafiz.” By fighting for nastaliq in the face of naskh, then, I feel that I am rejecting the cultural Arabization of South Asia.</p>
<p>... given that Urdu has 39 letters in their alphabet and Arabic has 28.</p>
<p>== Arabic in India</p>
<p>The author Tahera Qutbuddini (born in Mumbai), Professor of Arabic literature at the University of Chicago was awarded the Sheikh Zayed Book Award April 2021.</p>
<p><strong>source: <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20297278">https://www.jstor.org/stable/20297278</a></strong></p>
<p>(page 316)</p>
<p>Non-sacred Arabic hegemony was promoted in many parts of the world by political ,
social , and economic factors .  So much so , that in some of the lands conquered by the Arab Muslims, such as Coptic-speaking Egypt, Arabic almost entirely displaced and replaced the local languages .  In India, however , this did not happen , mainly because Arab Muslims did not have political control over more than the western provinces , and this control was for a limited time</p>
<p>The major Muslim dynasties in India were of Turkic origin , and their cultural language was , in the main , Persian &hellip;</p>
<p>(page 320)</p>
<p>Thus, the use of Persian in Indian Muslim liturgy is mostly Sufi and poetic, versus that of Arabic, which although making use of the the poetic tradition, as well as prose prayers and pious litanies, is based primarily on Quranic scripture.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>in the words of a modern scholar, &ldquo;Arabic, being the language of the original sources of Islam, was to be the major focus of study.  It was, so to speak, not only a language but the major linguistic symbolc of Islamic identity and Muslim resistance to modernity.&rdquo; 18</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the late eighteenth century, salafi madrasas purged the syllabus of Sufi texts (Arabic and Persian).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Large numbers of Hindus joined madrasas to acquire training in the Persian language and literature, with the intention of civil service careers.</p>
<p>(1996)&hellip;. the number of Persian madrasas in India is listed as 12, compared to the 757 Arabic madrasas mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(page 325)</p>
<p>Side by side with names of Persian or Indian origin, Muslims in India and converts to Islam often adopt Arabic personal names.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Probably due to the fact that most India Muslims do not understand Arabic grammar and vocabulary well, they sometimes inadvertently adopt the names of God - such as Rahman (the Merciful) and Jabbar (the most Powerful) - without a &ldquo;servant of&rdquo; prefix.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Indian Muslims take some Persian names such as Shirin, but do not adopt the names of the Persian Kings.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thus, comparing Arabic and Persian nomenclature in India, Arabic names and titles are most often related to religion and are from the religious tradition, whereas Persian ones are often kingly or literary.</p>
<p>(page 329)</p>
<p>Moreover, incorporating Arabic (and Persian) words and phrases into Indian-language is considered by Muslims a mark of refinement and religious learning.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Arabic scholarship is equated with Islamic scholarship, and experts in the Arabic language are ofenten the same scholars considered authorities in religion.  As such, both the language and its scholars are regarded with veneration, and the Arabic literary heritage is deemed to be the Islamic literary heritage.</p>
<p>... Indian Muslims also consider the study of all texts Arabic to be a religious exercise.</p>
<p>... Persian writing was gradually Indianized.  Much has been written about sabk-i hindi (Indian Style) of Persian literature, but the discussion has centered on rhetorical isssues to the exclusion of religious ones.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There do exist in India s small number of purely secular, utilatarian usages of Arabic, but these are so limited in application that we can consider them marginal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>... unlike the case of Arabic with its broad, multiple, but almost solely religious usages, the religious significance of Persian in Inida was mainly confined to the sphere of Sufi writing and rituals.  Moreover, its limited Islamic Islamic identity  was overshadowed by its use as the language of high culture and government administration. &hellip;. Mughal litterateurs who composed both in Arabic and Persian used Arabic for religious writings and Persian for secular ones. &hellip; the cultural hegemony of Persian ended definitively with the end of the Mughal Empire in the nineteenth century &hellip; in 1835.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The religious Sufi use of Persian in India had earlier suffered a blow in the late Mughal period itsel, with reformulation of Sufism.  Akbar&rsquo;s syncretic religious policies had evoked an orthodox reaction, represented by theologians like .. Dihlawi (d 1642), &hellip; Sirhindi (d 1624), who brought Indian Sufism close to non-Sufi Sunni Islam.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Aurangzebian de-emphasizing of Sufi Islam was further bolstered when, from the late eighteenth century onwards, parts of Indian Muslim populace under the growing influence of Arabian Wahabbi salafi thought. &hellip; Sayyid Ahmed Barelwi and Shah Wali Allah &hellip; The safalis emphsized a return to &ldquo;pre&rdquo; (Quran and Hadith-oriented, Arabic) Islam, and rejected what they perceived as impure accretions. &hellip; certain Indian Muslim reformers, even while using Persina in their own writings, began discouraging the study of Persain as something alien to Islam.  They contrasted it negatively with Arabic, which they venerated as the language of the Islamic scripture.</p>
<p>... (Shah Wali-Ullahs) Even though a Sufi master himself, he appears to have become a puristic in this second stage of his life, and he was the inspiration of the salafi Deobandh school. &hellip; In his Luminouse Esaay, he writes &hellip;</p>
<p>Among us [Indians], he is fortunate who cultivates an association with the Arabic language, [its] morphology, syntax, and works of literature; who obtains an understanding of the Hadith and the Quran.  As for Persian and Indian language works &hellip; reading them is error upon error .. [At the very least], one should realize that what they contain is worldly knowledge. ..&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The difference in the relative perceptions of Arabic and Persian in the nineteenth century - the first through the lense of scriptural religions, the second through the combined lens of Sufi Islam and Mughal high culture/administration - is the main reason why, after the end of the Mughal period, Persian almost disappeared in South Asia, even as a classicl laguage of learning, while Arabic maintained its positions.</p>
