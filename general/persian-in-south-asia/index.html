  <p>The spread of the Persian in the subcontinent began with the conquest of Ghazni&rsquo;s conquest of the Punjab. Although Persian was not the mother tongue of most of the rulers, it became the language of administration, courts, literary activity and high culture.  The Indo-Persian cultural tradition began during this period.</p>
<p>Farsi is Arabicised form of Parsi, the Arabic language does not have the phoneme /p/.  Zoroastrians in India are called Parasis.  The use of the term Parsi in English dates to 1790 whereas the term Farsi dates to 1926.  After the Arab conquests, the Coptic language in Egypt and Aramaic dialects in Syria went extinct and were replaced by Arabic.  However Persian mainiained its status as adminstrative language but saw its syntax and grammar significantly changed especially after establishment of Sahii Islam as the state relitoin by Safavid dynasty in 1502.  The old Pahlavi script was replaced by a modified form of the Arabic alphabet.</p>
<h2 id="indo-persian-and-iranian-persian">Indo-Persian and Iranian Persian</h2>
<p>The view that Indo-Persian is inferior to Iranian Persian is a more recent and has more to do with nationalism than any inherent quality.  Indians and Iranians living in India produced more important scholarly work than Iranians in Iran.</p>
<p>Most of the British scholarship on Persian in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was carried out by East India company bureaucrats in India.  The texts maintained by the Parsi community in India were used to construct the history of ancient Iran.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the Mughal reign, the Iranians continued to arrive at the Mughal court so foreign influence flourished. Persian being their mother tongue, they were welcomed and appointed at high posts without much competition. The Iranians were arrogant people and had a condescending attitude for the way the Indians spoke and wrote the Persian language. Shaikh Ali Hazin (d.1766) who arrived in India in the later Mughal period poured scorne on the Persian literary works of the Indians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The linguistic imperialism created a sense of inferiority among Indians while language created a gulf between the ruling classes and the common people. They always looked up to the Iranians for approval of their language but the Iranians refused to accept it as part of their literature. The tragic result was that after the fall of the Mughal Empire, Persian literature created by Indian writers disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After the arrival of the British, English became the official language. The Indian elite learnt it and became a part of the ruling class. Those who composed English poetry and wrote short stories and novels in English perhaps suffered a fate similar to the Persian writers who wasted their creativity on foreign language and lost their work without a trace.</p>

<h2 id="indo-persian-and-indian-history">Indo-Persian and Indian History</h2>
<p><strong>The History of India, as Told by its Own Historians</strong> is a collection of English translations completed in 1877.  One of the goals was to show that Indians were poor in producing historical records. It is essentially history from Indian Muslim rulers&rsquo; persepective.</p>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="http://muslimmodernities.org/uploads/Alam-Persian%20Lang%20in%20Mughal%20Politics.pdf">http://muslimmodernities.org/uploads/Alam-Persian%20Lang%20in%20Mughal%20Politics.pdf</a></strong></p>
<p>But Sanskrit, as Mirza Khan, the author of Tuhfat-ul-Hind, noted in Aurangzeb&rsquo;s time, was not taken as an ordinary human tongue; it was a Deva-banf and Akash-banf.  The language was too sacred, too divine.  No mlechha would perhaps have been allowed to pollute it by choosing it as a symbol and vehicle of his power.  The mlechha could not have used it to create the world of his vision.  On the contrary, Prakrit, which was Patal-banf, the language of the underground, of the snakes, was considered too low for the Mughals to be appropriated for lofty ideals.  Braj or Bhakha, the language of this world, was also a regional dialect.  Furthermore, Bhakha, in the Mughal view, was suitable only for music and love poetry.</p>
<p>Persian poetry, which had integrated many things from pre-Islamic Persia and had been an important vehicle of liberalism in the medieval Muslim world, helped in no insignificant way in creating and supporting the Mughal attempt to accommodate diverse religious traditions.  Akbar must have got support for his policy of non-sectarianism from the verses like the ones of Jalal-ud-Din Rumi whose masnawf the Emperor heard regularly and nearly learnt by heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Persian was not an Indian language, but it had begun to assume an autonomous Indian identity in pre-Mughal India.  Under the Mughals the Indian Persian diction matured, with some of the most brilliant writings in Persian.  However, the Iranian idiom of Persian also emerged as the favoured reference point in Mughal India.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nasir &lsquo;Ali Sirhindi (d.  1696), sensitive to the accomplishments of the Mughal poet, emphasized the difference between the Indian diction and the one popular with the Iranians and declared boastfully that &lsquo;The Iranian nightingale possessed little [similar] to the grandeur of the Indian peacock&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However., Arza&rsquo;s own writings are largely free from this tasarruf, implying, perhaps, that the ideal Persian was the unalloyed Iranian one. Even if it may not sound very much relevant here, AmIr Khusrau&rsquo;s pride in his Hindavi is noteworthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Persian in Mughal India, its wide use, long career and unparalleled contributions apart, continued to be taken as a foreign language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And as Persian signified high culture, being a language alien to the vast number of people, it perpetuated the distance between the rulers and the ruled.  The Mughals in their fascination for Persian failed to give meaningful patronage to any language of the land.  It was only in the late seventeenth century, when the regions began to assert their autonomy, that there seems to be a kind of Mughal policy to learn and encourage Hindavi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there is little in our sources to suggest if Hindavi at any stage in the seventeenth century was regarded as a language of the Mughal court or administration.  This was in sharp contrast to the developments in the regional Sultanates.  Ibrahim &lsquo;Adil Shah, who ascended the throne in Bijapur, the Deccan, in 942/1535-36, is reported to have proclaimed Hindavi (in this case Marathi) as the language of his government, entrusting all the important administrative and financial offices to the Brahmans.[3] Further, from the Barid Shahi Sultanate of Bidar (1503-1619), we have at least some inscriptions both in Persian and Marathi,&lsquo;04 while local language had the honour of being the language of the Sultan in Golconda.  Ibrahim Qutb Shah encouraged the growth of Telugu and his successor Muhammad QulI Qutb Shah patronized and himself wrote poetry in Telugu and in Dakhni.&lsquo;05 Abdullah Qutb Shah instituted a special office to prepare the royal edicts in Telugu (dabfrf-ye faramrn-i Hindavr).  While administrative and revenue papers at local levels in the Qutb Shahi Sultanate were prepared largely in Telugu, the royal edicts were often bilingual.[6] The last Qutb Shahi Sultan, Abul Hasan Tana Shah, sometimes issued his orders only in Telugu, with a Persian summary given on the back of thefarmans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This could be illustrated from the interest they showed in Hindavi.  Yet Hindavi was first Persianized before its entry into the charmed circle of the Mughal echelons.  The linguistic contestations had no religious bearings; they reflected, however, once again the tensions between the peoples in the regions and the Pers- ianized Mughal elites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Initially when our country was occupied by Arabs we were forced to replace the ‘P’ with the ‘F’, but what about now or all of these centuries ever since we have reclaimed our country and language? I believe we need to go back to the use of ‘Paars’ in place of ‘Faars’ and ‘Paarsi’ in place of ‘Faarsi’ when we converse in Persian. Other examples of this kind would be the conversion of such words as ‘Firuz’ to ‘Piruz’, ‘Dezful’ to ‘Dezhpol’ and ‘Esfahaan’ to ‘Espahaan’ spelled with the 15th letter of the alphabet.What reason could there be for us Persians to refer to our language in the same way as Arabs, who do not pronounce the letter ‘P’, do?</p>
