<p>Turbans as a distinctive sikh apparel seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon.  Most of the history of India is north India centric.</p>
<h1 id="modalities">Modalities</h1>
<h2 id="the-historiographic-modality">The historiographic Modality</h2>
<p>(page 5)</p>
<p>In British India, this modality is the most complex, pervasive, and powerful, underlying a number of the other specific modalities. &hellip; History in its broadest sense was a zone of debate over the ends and means of their rulership of India.</p>
<p>A second strand of the HM involved the ideological construction of the nature of Indian civilization as typefied in the major historical writings of Alexander Dow, Robert Orne, Charles Grant, Mark Wilks, James Mill, and James Todd. &hellip; beyond this they can be seen to have begun the formation of a legitimizing discourse about Britain&rsquo;s civilizing mission in India.</p>
<p>A third strand involves histories of the British in India. .. Black Hole of Calcutta, the defeat of Tipu Sultan, or the siege of Lucknow involved the creation of emblematic heroes and villains, ..; their &ldquo;history&rdquo; was made concrete through the consturction of memorials and sacred spaces in India.</p>
<h2 id="the-observationaltravel-modality">The Observational/Travel Modality</h2>
<p>... there are particular things that had to be included: the river front in Banaras, the fort of Allahabad, a visit with the Nawab of Oudh, sightseeing in Agra and Delhi.  In addition, travel accounts includes set pieces, such as the description of Indian holy men and their austerities, encounters with travelling entertainers, and a sati seen or heard about. &hellip; these includes dicussions of historical sites - Hindu, Muslim and British.</p>
<h2 id="the-survey-modality">The Survey Modality</h2>
<p>... the concept of the &ldquo;survey&rdquo; came to cover any systematic and official investigation of the natural and social features of the Indian empire.</p>
<h2 id="the-enumerative-modality">The Enumerative Modality</h2>
<p>It is my hypothesis that what was entailed in the construction of the census operation was the creation of the social categories by which India was ordered for administrative purposes. .. the project also objectified social, cultural, and lingustic differences among the people of India.  The panoptical view that the British were constructing led to the reification of India as polity in which conflict, from the point of view of the rulers, could only be controlled by the strong hand of the British.</p>
<h2 id="the-museological-modality">The Museological Modality</h2>
<p>For many Europeans India was a vast museum, .. source of collectibles and curiosities to fill European museums, botanical gardens, zoos, and country houses.</p>
<p>... The power to define the nature of the past and establish priorities in the creation of the monumental record of a civilization, and to propound canons of taste, are among the most significant instrumentalities of rulership.</p>
<h2 id="the-surveillance-modality">The Surveillance Modality</h2>
<p>... They were uncomforatble in the narrow confines of a city street, a bazaar, a mela - anywhere the were surrounded by their Indian subjects. &hellip; In the narratives of their lives and travels in India, few Indians are named other than royalty and personal servants.</p>
<p>There were, however groups and categories of people whose practises threatened the prescribed socialogical order.  .. sanyasis, fakirs, dacoits, goondas, thags (sic), patoralists, herders and entertainers.  &hellip; whole groups would be stigmatized as criminal.</p>
<p>Starting in the late eighteenth century, certain clans, castes, and villages were accused of practicings female infantacide &hellip; a crime difficult to prove in British courts, &hellip; it became a &ldquo;statistical crime&rdquo;..</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2-the-command-of-language-and-the-language-of-command">Chapter 2: The Command of Language and the Language of Command</h1>
<p>... The conquest of India was a conquest of knowledge.</p>
<p>...  They never seemed to realize that certain kinds of cloth and clothes, jewels, arms and animals had values that were not established in terms of a market-determined price, but were objects of culturally constructed system by which authority and social relations were literally constituted and transmitted.</p>
<h2 id="sanskrit-the-language-of-indian-law-and-lore">Sanskrit: The Language of Indian Law and Lore</h2>
<p>... Persian and Arabic were two &ldquo;classical&rdquo; languges of India&hellip;.</p>
<p>... In India the other &ldquo;classical&rdquo; languge, Sanskrit, was seen by the 17th and 19th century British as a secret language invented by the Brahmins to be mysterious repository for their religion and philosophy. &hellip; What knowlege the British had of the learning and religious thought of the Hindus came from the discussion with Brahmans and other high-caste Indians, or from Persian or &ldquo;Indostan&rdquo; translation of Sanskrit texts.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Following the current practice in Bengal, which was ruled by Muslims, the British accepted Muslim criminal law as the law of the land, but civil law was to be Hindu for Hindus and Muslim for Muslim for Muslims. &hellip; this decision by Hastings was to have profound effects on the course of the judicial system in India.</p>
<p>...  Halhed had very limited knowlege of Sanskrit and depended on Bengali or Hindustani explanations of passages in the text by the pandits, which discussions were then abstracted into Persian by Munshi, and from this Halhed did the final translation into English.</p>
<p>...  Briggs instructs his younger readers in these principles, as laid down by Manjor General Sir John Malcolm.  &ldquo;Almost all who, from knowledge and experience, have been capable of forming any judgement upon the question, are agreed that our power in India rests on the greatest opinion of the natives of our comparative superiority in good faith, wisdom, and strength, to their own rulers. ..&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="british-power-and-indian-knowledge">British Power and Indian Knowledge</h2>
<p>H.T. Colebrooke, in a letter to his father, described the ambivalence that characterized much of the British reaction to the Indian culture:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The further our literary inquiries are extended here, the more vast and stupendous the scene which opens to us; at the same time that the true and the false, the sublime and puerile, wisdom and absurdity, are so intermixed, that at every step, we have eo smile at folly, while we admire and acknowledge the philosophical true, though couched in obscure allegory and puerile fable&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Even with the undoubted good will and best intentions on part of Duncan, Hastings and others, a British metalogin of regularity, uniformity and above all fiscal responsibility could not help but participate in the erosion of what the British wanted to preserve, that is, Hindu and Muslim learning.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As Das points out, in the college there were two separate categories, sahibs and munshis. &hellip; but it was the British who set the agenda and who had authoritative voice in determining what was useful knowledge to be processed for the European projects: &ldquo;The Indian scholar knew he was superior to his Eurpean Master in respect of Indian languages, [but] he was primarily an informant, a mere tool in the exercise of language teaching to be handled by others.</p>
<p>... there was a major epistemological gulf between two cultures as well. &hellip; What baffled the British most about Indians&rsquo; prodigious feats of memorization was that it appeared to them that the Indians did not know the meaning of what they had internalized so effectively.</p>
<p>... What Ellis was pointing to was that the Indian more knowing and thinking was radically different from what the British assumed was the natural or normal form, and which they used as a standard by which they could adjudge Indian forms of knowledge as marred or inadequate, rather than different.  Indian reasoing was based, Ellis wrote, on &ldquo;the habit of their education,&rdquo; which rested on the memorization of the &ldquo;concentrated not diffuse knowledge,&rdquo; which was easier to comprehend in verse form.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4-artifacts-antiques-and-art-in-19th-century-india">Chapter 4: Artifacts, Antiques, and Art in 19th century India</h1>
<p>It was the British who, in the 19th century, defined in an authoritative and effective fashion how the value and meaning of the objects produced in India were determined. &hellip; By and large, until the early 20th century, Indians were bystanders to discussions and polemics which established meaning and value for the Europeans.  Even when increasing number of Indians entered into the discussion, the terms of the discourse and the agenda were set by European purposed and intentions.</p>
<h2 id="european-interpretive-strategies-for-knowing-india-1600-1750">European Interpretive Strategies for &ldquo;Knowing&rdquo; India 1600-1750</h2>
<p>... India was seen by the Europeans not only as exotic and bizarre but as a kind of living museum of the European past.</p>
<p>... The yogi, the sanyasi, the fakir, the sadhu had by the 18th century has been converted into living devils and the followers of all that was lascivious and degenerate in Greek and Roman religion, the worship of Pan and Priapus.</p>
<h2 id="europe-was-progressive-and-changing-india-static">Europe was progressive and changing, India static.</h2>
<p>... The British, in their construction of the history of India, came into the Indic world at one its periods of inevitable decay and degeneration into chaos. &hellip; The traditional Indian state was epiphenominal and it was found to have no political order, rather India turned out to be a land of unchanghing institutions based on family, caste, and the village community.</p>
<p>...
India was to be provided with a linear history following a 19th century positivist historiography as well.</p>
<p>... Wilson&rsquo;s primary interests were the Sanskrit language and Persian, which her viewed as the &ldquo;the chief vehicle of the modern history of India.&rdquo; &hellip; (<strong>comment: no interest in languages and history of south India</strong>)</p>
<p>... James Prinsep - who took a dim view of Luchmiah&rsquo;s qualifications and his plan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; the qualifications of Cavelly Venkata for such an office, &hellip; or indeed of any native, could hardly be pronounced equal for such a task, however useful they may prove as auxillaries in such a train of researcch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>... William Taylor, a missionary in Madras who had published some &ldquo;oriental historical manuscripts,&rdquo; ..</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s overriding theory, that Indian culture is derived from Chaldean or Egyptian origins.  .. There is little to wonder at in the Indian mind, degenerate and debased.  This is accounted for by the fact that &ldquo;The Hindu skull is of a lower order than that of [even] the Celtic, and very inferior [to the] broad Saxon skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor rejects the interpretation that the Indians have a theory of &ldquo;moral action.&rdquo; &hellip; Because of the despotic nature of the Indian state, there is no chance for manly virtues to develop among Indians, as they are brought up to &ldquo;cringe, fawn and flatter their rulers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>... The members of the Asiatic Society doubted Cavelly Venkata Luchmiah&rsquo;s credentials, and instead they selected a crackpot to edit Mackenzie&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<p>... The only way to survive and flourish in India is to remain totally separated from the degenerate races who inhabit the country, and they should live in such a fashion as to minimize the effects of the climate.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-5-cloth-clothes-and-colonialism">Chapter 5: Cloth, Clothes and Colonialism</h1>
<p>... Note that this excursus on the formation of the Sikhs and theiry symbology does not mention the turbans as part of their distinctive constume and apparel.  Most scholars who have written about the history of the Sikhs and their religion are silent on the question of when and how the turban became part of the representational canon of the community.  The wearing of turbans, though lacking &ldquo;formal sanction .. during the 19th and 20th centuries has been accorded an increasing importance in the endless quest for self-identification&rdquo; (<strong>Comment: Important point</strong>)</p>
<p>... the officers who had just fought the Sikhs &ldquo;insisted on the Sikh recruits being kesadhari, from among the Khalsa Sikhs who were unshorn.  Only those Sikhs .. wearing the badges of wildness, the beard and unshorn hair - were to be enrolled.</p>
<p>The bulk of their native army in north India rebelled.  The Sikhs enthusiastically and effectively participated in the defeat of their hated enemies, the remnants of the Mughals and their despised Hindu neighbors of the Ganges valley.  &hellip; The Punjab with 8 percent of population of India, provided half of their army in 1911.  The Sikhs, who were 1 percent by population, accounted for 20 percent of Indians in military service.</p>
<p>By the late 19th century a standardized Sikh turban, as distinct from the turban of Punjabi Muslims and Hindu Dogras, had emerged and had become hallmark of the Sikhs in the army.  During WWI, &hellip; &ldquo;the Sikhs had come to associate their uniform pagri with their religion, and the argument that the turban as such was not prescribed by their religious code was to no avail.</p>
<p>... Over time the military-style turban became general, although far from universal, among the Sikhs.</p>
<p>... The wearing of Indian dress in public functions by employees of the Company was officially banned in 1830.</p>
<h1 id="orientalizing-india">&ldquo;Orientalizing&rdquo; India</h1>
<p>The application of social evolutionary theories to India by wide range of British officials and scholars yielded a crucial ruling paradigm: the Indian present was the European past.  The construction of a universal history enabled the British to control the  Indian past, as they had been feudal but were now advanced out of this stage.</p>
<p>... Indian were given &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; head gear &hellip;</p>
<p>Henceforth, the British should rule in an &ldquo;oriental manner&rdquo;, with strength and with the expectation of instant obedience.</p>
<p>For this reason, Indian more than ever should like Indians; &hellip; Indians, it was believed were susceptible to show and drama, and hence more occasions were found where rulers and subjects could play their appointed parts and could act out their &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; through costume.</p>
<p>From the middle of the 19th century, the British at home increasing invented or reinvented civic rituals at all levels of the polity.  These rituals called for the creation of costumes, regalia, and accouterments to mark them as special and hallowed by tradition. &hellip; transported to India &hellip;</p>
