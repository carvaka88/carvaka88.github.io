  <p>Some quotes of teaching and status of Arabic in Pakistan.</p>
<h2 id="pakistani-national-anthem-is-in-persian">Pakistani National Anthem is in Persian</h2>
<p>Pakistan’s national anthem is written in the Persian language and it has only a single word “ka” in its national language Urdu.</p>

<p>For seven long years after the inception of their country, the people of Pakistan could not sing their national anthem. The reason? They simply didn’t have one.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the time, Bengalis living in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had been demanding that the national anthem must also include words of Bengali language, but their demand was turned down.</p>

<p>Islam is used as a symbol of national integration in the face of the threat from ethnicities.  Arabic, being an Islamic language, .. was considered as an antidote to ethnicity, especially Bengali ..</p>
<p>In April 1950, Zahid Husain, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, said that the Arabic should be the national language of Pakistan.  &hellip; he was opposed ..  On Feb 10, 1951, Aga Khan pleaded the case for Arabic</p>
<p>The government of Pakistan, realised &hellip; impracticability of using Arabic as an official language because nobody, not even religious scholars, could actuall use it. &hellip; it was entirely ignored as a language of scholarship.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>East Pakistan should adopt Pak Bangla, .. a Bengali version written in Arabic script and purged of Sanskritic words.</p>
<p>Bengali script .. derivative of the Brahmi family of scripts, was associated with Hindu identity, and hence had to be Islamized.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>During Bhutto&rsquo;s rules, &hellip; For religious or symbolic, reasons the 1973 constitution made the state committed to encouraging and facilitating the learning of Arabic lanuage.</p>
<p>...
Arabic introduced as a compulsory subject in classes 6th to 8the in the state schools&hellip;..</p>
<p>In the National Education Policy of 1979 Arabic was explicitly, and emphatically, connected with the ideology of Pakistan and with Islam.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Arabic was not taught in most private schools, &hellip; it was not taught even in state
administered schools in all the provinces.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Arabic script was taught to all students here (muhallah schools) because reading the Quran, without, however understanding it, was compulsory</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Arabic is used more in Pakistan than Persian which was once so crucial a part of Muslim elitist culture.  &hellip; both because .. Arabic is a religious symbol &hellip; useful for employment in Gulf countries.</p>

<p>The government of Pakistan, however, realised from the beginning the impracticability of using Arabic as an official or national language because nobody, not even the religious scholars, could actually use it</p>
<p>...  but the fact was that Arabic was hardly more than a symbol and a pious cliché. The ruling elite and the public in general did not take any serious interest in acquiring it.</p>
<p>(page 421)</p>
<p>Arabic occupies the centre stage in all madrasahs and is sometimes claimed to be the medium of instruction in them, which it is not.</p>
<p>Modernist Muslims in India, especially those connected with Aligarh, kept pointing out that the graduates of madrasahs could neither speak nor write Arabic.</p>
<p>(page 436)</p>
<p>Arabic is used more in Pakistan than Persian which was once so crucial a part of Muslim elitist culture. This is both because Arabic is a religious symbol and because it is useful for employment in the Arab world.</p>

<p>In an official function held in the ancient city of Taxila, this past Saturday, the Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Mohammad Yousuf had some important news for the country.</p>
<p>Speaking to the press at Wah Cantonment, the Minister announced that groundwork was complete for the introduction of Arabic as a language in the secondary school curriculum.  The project of Arabicising Pakistan, the painstaking wiping away, hammering out breaking off and denunciation of all parts of our past that do not fit into an imagined always Muslim-ness is not a new one.</p>

<p>However, after the 1971 East Pakistan debacle, the state with the help of conservative historians and ulema made a conscious effort to divorce Pakistan’s history from its Hindu and Persian past and enact a project to bond this history with a largely mythical and superficial link with Arabia.</p>
<h2 id="the-arabist-shift-from-indo-persian-civilization-in-pakistan">The Arabist Shift from Indo-Persian Civilization in Pakistan</h2>
<p>**Author: Arshi Saleem Hashmi <a href="mailto:arshihashmi1@gmail.com">arshihashmi1@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>The Zia regime linked Arabism with Islam, not realizing or deliberately ignoring the fact that Islam is a religion, while “Arabism” is more of a cultural notion. “Islamization” of the society through “Arabization” was considered the right policy. To prepare the next generation of young Pakistanis full of Islamic zeal and “well informed” of their glorious past beginning with Arab Islamic history, education was the first casualty that came under attack. As Moeed Yusuf puts it</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pakistani textbooks were reoriented during General Zia-ul-Haq’s Islamization&hellip;currently present Pakistan&hellip;is under threat from a Hindu India on the one hand and an anti- Islamic West on the other&hellip;an inherently paranoid outlook does make the younger generation more susceptible to Islamist ideologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Roots of the crisis of Muslim identity go back to the pre-partition era. The issue of social purity emerged after the decline of Muslim power, when Shah Waliullah and other Muslim revivalists in the sub-continent attempted to preserve the distinct identity of the Muslim community through strict adherence to pure Islam.  These individuals felt that the Indian Muslims had become socially and culturally “polluted” owing to their close association with Hindus. This thinking translated into the need for distancing Muslims from the Hindus through the creation of a separate homeland and pursuing religion without any extraneous influences.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As some scholars have opined, “Arabization and Islamization are inseparable parts of a single cultural ideal”, this view now pervades the Muslim world. In their drive towards authentification and uniformization of Islam, the transmitters (Saudi Arabia and other Arabic countries) and the recipients (non-Arab Islamic societies) equally emphasized ‘Arabization’ as the norm of pure and ideal form of Islam to be followed by Muslims.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Historically, Wahabism never took roots in the region because it prohibited a lot of practices that were common in life. In the words of Curtin Winsor, “Wahhabism was largely confined to the Arabian Peninsula until the 1960s, when the Saudi monarchy gave refuge to radical members of the Muslim Brotherhood fleeing persecution in Nasser&rsquo;s Egypt.”12</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The new Islamic identity was then the steady process of transformation from a secular, inclusive and an adaptive form of Islam to a more textual, ritualistic and exclusive one guided by exogenous forces, as ideas, practices and finances that flowed in from the Arab world.</p>
<h2 id="claiming-lineage-to-saudi-arabia-on-the-basis-of-religion">Claiming Lineage to Saudi Arabia on the Basis of Religion</h2>
<p>...</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to note that this Arabization is more of a cultural issue than a religious one, though the radicals try to convince the simple people that by adopting the Arab culture , they would be on their way to be a good Muslim.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Pakistan grappled with the question of its identity – whether to be a secular democratic country for Muslims and other religious minorities or an Islamic state – even before it was formed in 1947.  Pakistan&rsquo;s Muslim population is divided into the Sunni and Shia sects, and is also home to smaller sects such as the Ismailis, the followers of Aga Khan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Saroosh Irfani explains that with the advent of the “Arab-Afghans’ and Taliban, the synthesizing impulse of Indo-Persian culture was largely eclipsed by an ‘Arabist shift’- the tendency to view the present in terms of an imagined Arab past with the Arabs as the only “real/pure” Muslim, and then using this trope of purity for exorcising an “unIslamic” present.25</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Moderate non-Arab Muslims all over the world and Pakistanis in particular need to work for reinventing the happy synthesis of culture and religion rather than being influenced by Arabization to prove their true Islamic credentials. De-Arabization can help Pakistan ease relations with its immediate South Asian neighbors with whom relations have been severely affected due to the deliberate association with the Middle East.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the more Pakistan tries to associate itself with the Arab world, the more it is reminded of its non-Arab credentials and its South Asian roots. The recent crisis in Pakistan has exposed the Arab lack of empathy vis-a-vis insurgency and militancy in Swat.</p>
<h2 id="al-bakistan">Al Bakistan</h2>

<p>A number of people have pointed out the sudden proliferation of the ‘Al Bakistan’ number plates. Initially, I thought these were just on cars imported from the UAE or other Arab countries, but seeing them locally produced has made it clear that they are simply used as status symbols. It is also rather amusing that while Pakistan lost its ‘P’ in Arabic transliteration, ‘Punjab’ retained its — maybe the charm of the Punjab transcends our Arabisat ion!</p>
