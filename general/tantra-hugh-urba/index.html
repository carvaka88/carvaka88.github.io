  <p>This is an example of progression from Indomania to Indophonia, under the influence of Christian and Evangelical who wanted to emancipate natives socially and culturally.</p>
<p>Alberuni and Marco Polo describe groups of yogis as well as rasayana with goals of &ldquo;logevity and immortality&rdquo;, they are not described as &ldquo;Tantra&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jones (1790) lumps &ldquo;tantras&rdquo; with Mantras, Agama and Nigams Sastras, he compares Kali to the goddess Diana. Colebrook &hellip; tantras as the antipode of the Vedas.  Vedas were supposed to represent pristine monotheistic past whereas rituals from Puranas and Tantras embody polytheism and idolatory&gt;</p>

<p>... the colonial era witnessed a clear &ldquo;trend toward conceiving of a new entiry called Tantrism as a specific modality of Indian religious experience&rdquo; &hellip; which assimilated the diverse body of texts &hellip; and the vast body of traditions into a singular universal entity.</p>
<p>The European fascination with Tantra, I will argue, is very much a part of this larget preoccupation with sexuality and its aberrations in the Western imagination.</p>
<p>(page 46)</p>
<p>Indeed, discourse on Tantra became a central element in the narrative of Indian history: namely, the widely accepted narrative of the decline of medieval Hinduism, that it had become corrupted with Tantric immorality, a degenaration that had paved the way for the Muslim (and thereafter British) cconquest.</p>
<p>(page 47)</p>
<p>It is probably no accident that the emergence of &ldquo;Tantrism&rdquo; as a distinct category of religion occured at roughly the same as the emergence of &ldquo;Hinduism&rdquo; itself in the Western imagination.  Even as European scholars began to construct the abstract entity called Hinduism - itself largely &ldquo;a Western inspired abstraction which until the nineteenth century bore little resemblance of Indian religious belief and practice&rdquo; - they began to imagine Tantrism as one of its primary, though least adminrable, components.</p>
<p>(page 47)</p>
<p>... as Ron Inden has persualively argued, India came to be imagined as an essentially passionate, irrational, and erotic world - a land of &ldquo;disorderly imagination&rdquo; set in opposition to the progressive, rational, and scientific world of modern Europe.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Tantra formed a critical part of the broader project of imagining India, precisely because Tantra was regarded as the most extreme, irrational emodiment of the worst tendencies in the Indian mind.</p>
<p>(page 48)</p>
<p>Tantra would become an important focus of these shifting attitudes toward the Indian religions and quickly singled out as one the native customs most in need of reform. &hellip; early romantics and the later Indophobes agreed that the Tantras represented the worst and most decadent era in Indian history &hellip;  as Kopf remarks, &ldquo;contrasting set of images: the golden age, which is Indo-Aryan, classical brahmanical and elitist versus a dark age which medieval .. orgiastic and corrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Indeed, up to the end of the eighteenth century, as we see in the works of of the earliest British authors &hellip; Tantrism had no yet emerged as a distinct category or a definable body of texts.  Even James Mill&rsquo;s The History of British India, makes no mention of the Tantras.</p>
<p>Rather significantly, the first detailed discussions of the tantras come from Christian missionaries.</p>
<p>His primary motivations (self admitted) was to &ldquo;highlight grandeur of Christendom&rdquo;.  He does identigy Sakti-Puja as &ldquo;Tantra&rdquo;, it became key part of most later European accounts and became a key element of the early genealogy of Tantrism.  Reverend William Ward (1817) called tantras as quintessence of degenerate spirit of licentious appetite.  In H.H. Wilson&rsquo;s (1828) account tantras are now considerd a &ldquo;singular category&rdquo;, although numerous were supposed to be the same.  Monier-Williams who employed the term &ldquo;Tantrism&rdquo; which identifies with &ldquo;Saktism&rdquo; and called it the most degenerate form of India religion.  Finally in early twentieth century Tantrism became infamous.  It became conflated into a bizarre mixture of a Black Mass, a Roman Saturnalia, a scene of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, and a Dionasian sporagmos.  Orientalists also blamed Tantrism for the historical degeneration of Buddhism.</p>
<p>(page 55)</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to Max Muller, Gustav Oppert, and other, the &ldquo;Aryan race had emerged in the Western imagination as an essentially masculine, aggresive, patriarchical culture, which had progressively invaded and conquered the more passive, feminine, and goddess-worshipping non-Aryan or Dravidian peoples.  &hellip; Not surpisingly, the develiopment of Tantra was quickly identified with the imagined non-Aryan, Dravidian goddess-worshipping culture of pre-Vedic India.  Tantra was the very essence of this &ldquo;feminine,&rdquo; weak and and passive race. (ms: This basically justified the living and virile British rule of Aryan stock.  Tantra came to represent the epitome of depravity.  Indians assimilated many Orientalist paradigms such as a progressive devolution from the Golden age of the Vedas to the modern, degenarate age of the Tantras).</p>
