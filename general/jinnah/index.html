<h2 id="quotes---pervez-hoodbhoy">Quotes - Pervez Hoodbhoy</h2>
<p><strong>Source <a href="http://www.sacw.net/HateEducation/1985HoodbhoyNayyar06022005.html">http://www.sacw.net/HateEducation/1985HoodbhoyNayyar06022005.html</a></strong></p>
<p>For Jinnah the matter was particularly clear: he wanted a homeland for the Muslims, not an Islamic state.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Indeed, there were expectations of a critical assessment of the role of elites and readjustment of regional policies within Pakistan following the 1971 civil war and the subsequent Indian invasion. In this war, tens of thousands died, millions were displaced, and the country was rent asunder. Thirteen years later, this optimism has proven to be unfounded.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thus, the Hindu is portrayed as monolithically cunning and treacherous, obsessively seeking to settle old scores with his erstwhile masters. This Hindu is responsible for the break-up of Pakistan:</p>
<p>The same Bengali Hindu was responsible for the backwardness of East Pakistan. But, hiding the story of his two-century old sins, atrocities, and pillage, he used &lsquo;Bengali nationalism&rsquo; to punish innocent West Pakistanis for sins they had not committed.</p>
<p>Justice Shameem Hussain Kadri, ex-chief justice of the Lahore High Court, writes of the &lsquo;diabolical Hindus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hindu conspiracies&rsquo; in his officially circulated book.  There are countless similar examples.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah himself a Twelver Shia following his conversion from the Ismaili sect, needed two separate funerals – one according to the Sunni rituals in the open and the other before that according to Shia norms in his home – to appease Shiaphobes in 1948.</p>

<p>His father belonged to the Khoja community which owes its allegiance to the Aga Khan.  This sect is not technically Shiite but observes several Hindu ceremonies and customs.  In fact even their prayer or their manner of praying doe not strictly conform to Islamic precepts; ..  Until recently the orthodox Muslims of various schools did not recognize Aga Khani Khojas as true Muslims.  &hellip; in order to get proper religious acceptance among the genrality of Muslims he changed his sect much later and became an Asnashari.</p>
<p>(page 2)</p>
<p>Jinnah could neither read the Quran, nod did say his prayers not fast in Ramadan.  &hellip; He did not perform the Haj either which is one of the cardinal articles of the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>(page 5)</p>
<p>In India he wore the traditional Khoja dress &ndash; a long coat and the Aga Khani cap but now he gave up these for western attire &hellip;  Wolpert observed: &ldquo;He also traded in his traditional Sindhi long yellow coat &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(page 6)</p>
<p>... Jinnah did not know that any representation of the figure of the Prophet is strictly prohibited by Islam.</p>
<p>(page 8)</p>
<p>His father, having lost everything in Karachi, came to Bombay with the entire family but Jinnah could not be of much help.  Disappointed with his attitude the family went to Ratnagiri .. and settled there.  Jinnah did not maintain contact with any member except his younger sister Fatima..</p>
<p>(page 9)</p>
<p>In 1906 Jinnah even refused to join the All-India Muslim League, founded in Dacca as a counter force to the Congress.</p>
<p>(page 11)</p>
<p>Jinnah defended him (Tilak) in the trial court.  .. Jinnah used to be .. horrified at the sycophancy exhibited by Muslim aristocrats and publicly opposed the need to for the League.</p>
<p>(page 87)</p>
<p>He (Jinnah( had been in constant touch with Churchill who had grown quite fond of him ..  .. He (Churchill) regarded the Hindu-Muslim feud as the bulwark of British rule in India.</p>

<p>Most Muslims regarded Khojas (from Persian Khwaja a noble man) .. akin to banias, to be apostates.  The fact is that Khojas felt closer to the fire-workshipping Zoroastrians (Parsis) and settled in India, since both groups had fled persecution in Persia.</p>
<p>... Jinnah did not come from a long lineage of Muslims.  His ancestors were non-Muslimas, most likely Hindus ..</p>
<p>(page 89)</p>
<p>... in thw words of Sarojini Naidu, was &ldquo;Hindu by race and Muslim by religion&rdquo;, symbolized composite culture at that time.</p>
<p>He hardly ever visited a mosque or prayed to Allash; it is doubtful he ever read the Quran.  He drank alcohol and ate pork regularly.  .. his lifestyle was closer to that of the British gentry tnan to the North Indian Muslims he claimed to represent toward the last part of his political career.</p>

<p>The only advisor Jinnah had was apparently Jinnah himself. In one meeting, Jinnah had said once Pakistan was created, his followers would regard his word as the word of God. A premier of Punjab had said that a better name for Pakistan would be Jinnistan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>To push his argument, Jinnah famously declared to much applause among the Muslims: ‘We will have India divided or India destroyed.’ Eventually the Crown granted his wish. But what he got was a ‘moth-eaten’ Pakistan.</p>
<p>.&hellip;</p>
<p>The Bengali students jeered and “leaped onto their seats and shouted, ‘No, no!’ as he spoke. The Quaid seemed taken aback, and paused for a moment before resuming his speech. He held no other public meetings before returning to Karachi at the end of the month. It was his first and last visit to East Bengal.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>He had thought that India would be called Hindustan after partition. But it retained its name and Pakistan was viewed as the seceding country.</p>

<p>Jinnah thought the Muslim intelligentia was selfish, intellectually corrupt, and lacked character. Unsurprisingly, “Jinnah had few Muslim friends and his views of the community he sought to lead indicated a notion of representation that was not premised upon his identification with them.”</p>

<p>Even Jinnah began using “Inshallah” in his speeches.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Disillusioned by Jinnah’s promises about the rights of minorities, J.N. Mandal, the leader of the local Dalits who had been sworn in as a member of the Constituent Assembly in Pakistan, migrated to India in 1950.</p>

<p>III</p>
<p>To Woodrow Wyatt (British MP) in his &ldquo;Confessions of an Optimist&rdquo; over Whisky and Soda, Jinnah &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the British drop all talk of Independece? It&rsquo;s not necessary and it will do no good.  If you said you would stay, the Muslims woudl fight for you and we could rule India together forever.  The Hindus are too feeble to resist and everyone would be happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Jinnah&rsquo;s ancestors were Hindu Rajputs. &hellip; The forefathers of Jinnah were Khoja Muslims .. and belonged to the Aga Khan&rsquo;s Ismaili sect and were Shias.</p>
<p>... Poonja Meghji had five children, four of them were named Manbai, Valji, Nathoobai and Jinnahbhai.  &hellip; For the first time in his family, Poonja Jinnahbahi, the father of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, discarded the practice of giving Hindu names to his children.  Poonha Meghji, the grandfather of Jinnah, had given Hindu names to his children and had followed most of the Hindu religious rituals.  .. It was Poonja Jinnabhai, &hellip; also dropped the ancient customary Hindu rite of observing Chatti, the sixth day after the birth of the child, when blessing of Hindu deities are invoked after a purificatory bath.  And it was Poonja Jinnabhai who began giving lessons in the Quran to his children.</p>
<p>Jinnah was heard explaining to Horniman that &ldquo;the sect among the Muslims to which he belonged believed in the ten avatars and had much in common with Hindus in their inheritance laws and social customs&rdquo; (Martin Gilbert, Winston Churchill, Never Despair, 1945-1965 p292)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Jinnah was not a religious man.  He seldom visited a mosque of offered namaz.  (1936) &hellip;  Jinnah told him that he had never visited a mosque and was not very good in offering prayers.  In the mosque Jinnah took out his shoes and sat, he did not know how to go down on his knees.  I was aghast to see him squatting like a Hindu Brahmin with knees and hands foldded.</p>

<p>Under Iqbal’s influence from 1937 onwards and after Partition, Jinnah’s speeches were laced with imageries from Islam. He made statements: “Muslims… have not been crushed during the last 1,000 years”; “I shall never allow Muslims to be slaves of Hindus”; “The cows that Hindus worship Muslims eat; the villains that Hindus malign, Muslims idolise”; “The goal of Pakistan is not only to get freedom and autonomy but the Islamic concept of life”; “It is Prophet Muhammad’s spiritual blessing that Pakistan came into being. Now it is Pakistanis’ responsibility to turn it into the model (state) of the Righteous Caliphs.” Owaisi can hardly disagree with Jinnah.</p>
<h2 id="quotes-from-book-review-akbar-ahmed">Quotes from Book Review (Akbar Ahmed)</h2>
<p>(Posters note: Akbar Ahmed is the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington, D.C..  Here is what the well known Daws columnist Irfan Hussain columnist had to say about Akbar Ahmed.)</p>
<p><strong>Source: <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1023105">http://www.dawn.com/news/1023105</a></strong></p>
<p>For those not familiar with the background, Akbar Ahmed is an ex-civil servant who, according to Khalid, named a street after himself while serving as a district officer in Balochistan many years ago.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Much to his credit, his persistence paid off and the movie was completed. But sadly, here is when things went off the rails: Jamil Dehlavi, the director, sued Ahmed to get his contracted fees. He went on to accuse him of taking the credit (and the money) for the script when the real scriptwriter was Farrukh Dhondi, the Indian-born author. (At the last Karachi Literary Festival, Dhondi confirmed his role to me.)</p>

<p>The uncritical, pedestrian biography by Stanley Wolpert, the malevolent Jinnah we encounter in Richard Attenborough&rsquo;s film biopic of Gandhi and the unattractive figure found in the standard lives of Nehru and Gandhi are all one-dimensional and unsatisfying, the work of hagiographers, popularisers and demonologists.</p>
<p>.&hellip;</p>
<p>Ahmed&rsquo;s revisionist take on Jinnah is that he evolved from &ldquo;a seemingly secular politician&rdquo; into &ldquo;the champion of an exclusive Muslim identity&rdquo;, an Islamic role model who provides &ldquo;a response to (contemporary) negative media images&rdquo; of Islam.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But the attempt to reinvent Jinnah as a distinctly Muslim personality is ingenuous, for even his admirers have rarely disputed Jalal&rsquo;s argument that &ldquo;Jinnah&rsquo;s appeal to religion was &hellip; a political tactic, not an ideological commitment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Briefly, his argument is as follows. After Lord and Lady Mountbatten arrived in Delhi in the spring of 1947, Nehru became involved with Edwina Mountbatten in order &ldquo;to command the viceroy&rsquo;s office through his bedroom&rdquo;. Nehru was, according to Ahmed, the Jewish Edwina&rsquo;s &ldquo;demon lover&rdquo;, who turned her against Jinnah and the Muslim League by saying they were like Nazis. In addition to the political advantage to be gained from Lady Mountbatten, Ahmed claims that Nehru was drawn to her because &ldquo;sex with the memsahib was the ultimate taboo &hellip; the ultimate racial and colonial metaphor for power&hellip; (Nehru) had conquered the white woman &hellip; it was the ultimate victory, the planting of the flag on top of Everest.&rdquo; According to Ahmed, compromising letters between Edwina and Nehru were intercepted and made available to Jinnah who refused to use them, saying that &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s wife should be above suspicion&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this was not his kind of politics&rdquo;.</p>
