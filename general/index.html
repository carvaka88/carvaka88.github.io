  <p>general content</p>

  
    <h2><a href="/general/hindi-and-urdu/">Hindi and Urdu</a></h2>
    <p>Hindi and Urdu (Hindustani/Hindvi) have the same syntax and grammar and the language shares its origin with other Indo-European languages such as Bengali, Oriya, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi etc.</p>

    <p>Mahipati composed Santavijaya almost a century after Samarth Ramdas&rsquo;s death in 1681.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/general/history/">History and Narratives</a></h2>
    <p>Frequently historians present themselves as objective observers just using evidence to presen the history.  However to me it appears that many have some framework and narrative in mind and then choose evidence to fit the story they want to tell.</p>

    <h2><a href="/general/trautman/">Trautmann: Aryans and British India</a></h2>

    <h2><a href="/general/persian-in-south-asia/">Persian in South Asia</a></h2>
    <p>The spread of the Persian in the subcontinent began with the conquest of Ghazni&rsquo;s conquest of the Punjab. Although Persian was not the mother tongue of most of the rulers, it became the language of administration, courts, literary activity and high culture.  The Indo-Persian cultural tradition began during this period.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/general/tantra-hugh-urba/">Tantra: Hugh B. Urban</a></h2>
