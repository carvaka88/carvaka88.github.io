  <h1>Neglect: Shivaji Samadhi</h1>

  
  
  
  

  <p>Many Mumbai landmarks have been named renamed for Shivaji.  It is interesting to note that his Samadhi was poorly maintained until late 19th century</p>
<p>In his traveloue, &ldquo;A Book of Bombay&rdquo; (published in 1883), James Douglas writes (page 433):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>His mausoleum is on the yonder knoll, its interior a mass of weeds, 
trees growing up through the pavement of its dhuramasalla; 
its temple foul and dishonored, and its gog cast down to the ground. 

[The footnote says: The sacred bull had toppled over and lying on its back]

No man now cares for Seevaji.  Over all those wide domains, which once 
owned him Lord and Master, acquired by so much blood and treasure ..
not one man now contributes a rupee to keep or repair the tomb of the
founder of the Mahratta empire.&#34;  
</code></pre><p>[Lost the reference for this]</p>
<p>Douglas recommended that some money be allocated to maintain the samadhi.  The Public works department was given some funds to maintain Shivaji&rsquo;s samadhi at Raigarh.</p>
<p>Douglas further urged the British Government, who had acquired the Kingdom of Shivaji and his successors to look into this matter, in a note in which he said, &ldquo;The British Government conserves the architectural remains of Tudor and Stuarts. Will not the Bombay Government do as much for the tomb, the temple and the arch of Shivaji? A few crumbs that fall from the archaeological bureau of Western India would suffice to keep in repair memorials of a dashing and most romantic period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remarks of James Douglas about the neglect of the forts in general and Raigad in particular also created a stir in Maharashtra and both the press and the intellectuals resented the Government policy strongly. Raigad was made the symbol of patriotism, and people were reminded by the Press, as early as 1885, of their negligence of patriotism. Justice M.G. Ranade, the author of the famous classic `Rise of the Maratha Power&rsquo; organised a public meeting at Hirabag in Pune in 1886 to promote interest in the issue of Shivaji Memorial. It was attended by many important people including the Maratha Sardars, Landlords and even the representative of the Kolhapur State.</p>
<p>V.N. Mandlik (1895) &hellip; after personally visiting the Raigad fort concurred with James Douglas&rsquo;s views which were reproduced again in his book Bombay and Western India in 1893 about the deplorable condition of the shrine of Maharaja Shivaji at Raigad. This kindled the imagination of Tilak and in his article in the Kesari of April 23, 1895 he condemned himself and the sardars and jagirdars for letting the samadhi to fall into decay. He wrote sarcastically, but the sardars and the chiefs knew that they are not likely to be benefited by Shivaji as he is dead and gone. This exhortation had its desired effect in attracting people from all strata of society and raising the funds for repairs, maintenance, a chhatri on the tomb, and annual birthday celebration. He made this a issue of national interest and gave to it the shape of a movement which was later on known as the Shivaji Movement which spread in the other parts of the country like Bengal, United Provinces, Assam and some places in the South as a political movement and a part of the India&rsquo;s struggle fir freedom.</p>
