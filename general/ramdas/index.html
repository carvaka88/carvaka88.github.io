  <p>Mahipati composed Santavijaya almost a century after Samarth Ramdas&rsquo;s death in 1681.</p>
<p>It was translated into English by Justin E. Abbott in 1932.  An online version is available at <strong><a href="https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.61797/2015.61797.Mahipati-Ramdas-Santavijaya_djvu.txt">https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.61797/2015.61797.Mahipati-Ramdas-Santavijaya_djvu.txt</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The long biography (by Mahipati) contains eight brief references to Muslims; the first one is to Sheikh Muhammad .. who is described as &ldquo;a great bhakta, a man of bhakti, knowledge, and indifference to worldly things, who expressed his thoughts in poetry.  A second one is to the Muslims servants of Shivaji, who join in ecstatic dancing during one of Ramdas&rsquo;s Kirtan .. two more are brief allusions to the stringencies of Muslim rule; .. &ldquo;corrupt Muhammadan kings are ruling, and continually troubling their subjects,&rdquo; but this is accompanied by a litany of other kali-age woes, such as corrupt Brahmins and ineffective mantras.  Two more allude to Aurangzeb&rsquo;s campaigns in Deccan, and these highlight both his agression and his broad minded piety, noting that, although he &ldquo;brought distress on cows and Brahmans .. whenever he saw any miraculous deed, he was ready to bow in reverence&rdquo;. Thus when Aurangzeb&rsquo;s army attacks Sajjangarh fort where Ramdas is residing, Maruti sends an army of monkeys to protect it; Aurangzeb, impressed by the power of &ldquo;the Hindu fakir,&rdquo; orders the Mughal army to retreat.  Finally, there occur two confrontations between Ramdas and Muslim officials who are harassing devotees; each ends with the saint lecturing the erring official on the spiritual brotherhood of Hindus and Muslims and composing lyric devotional poems &ldquo;in the Musalmani language&rdquo; (Persian or Deccani Urdu), which are admired by his listeners.  &hellip;. When the pandits try to humiliate Ramdas by attacking his writings, he has an outcast (mahar) woodcutter lecture them to remove their ignorance.  And Shivaji first asks Ramdas his caste, the latter laughs and says that he belongs to the &ldquo;monkey class&rdquo; like the companions of Rama, who had no concern for worldly status.</p>

<p>[Poster&rsquo;s note: Sheikh Muhammad wrote Yogasangram and seems to have disappeared from history of saints in Maharashtra]</p>
<p>According to Mahipati, Ramdas had more prolonged problems with Brahmans; five lengthy passages depict their arrogance, their jealosy of the saint&rsquo;s influence at the court, and their strident opposition to Ramdas&rsquo;s unorthodox behavior based on what they call &ldquo;his own private opinions.&rdquo;  They especially object to his initiation of women, placing them in charge of monasteries, and permitting them to to give spiritual discourses; and his insistence on using Marathi language than Sanskrit. .. Ramdas&rsquo;s first initiated disciple is a barber, and when he permits a Brahman to become the latter&rsquo;s pupil, he again arouses ire of pandits, ..</p>
