  <h1>Hindi and Urdu</h1>

  
  
  
  

  <p>Hindi and Urdu (Hindustani/Hindvi) have the same syntax and grammar and the language shares its origin with other Indo-European languages such as Bengali, Oriya, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi etc.</p>
<p>Urdu nouns and adjectives have origins in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Pushtu etc but over ninety-nine percent of verbs have their roots in Sanskrit or Prakrit (<strong><a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/681263/urdus-origin-its-not-a-camp-language">http://www.dawn.com/news/681263/urdus-origin-its-not-a-camp-language</a></strong>)</p>
<p>Urdu as a name for the language seems to have occured for the first time in 1780s.  The split between Hindi and Urdu from a common language began with Islamization(?) or Persianization of Urdu in the eighteenth century.  As Mughal empire declined, the situation in North India became increasingly unstable and chaotic.  This resulted in erosion of privlieged perch of the Muslim elites.  Many of them ascribed their misfortune to their departure from orthodox Islam.  They used Urdu as one of the symbols for a distinct religious, culural and political identity.  Words that had indigineous roots were considered un-Islamic and thousands of words such as nain (eye), prem (love), mohan (dear one) were expunged.</p>
<p>Sansritization of Hindi which begain in early nineteenth century can be viewed from two perspectives: one is as a response to Persianizationi/Arabization of Urdu and second as a general trend in Sanskritization of languages such as Bengali, Gujarati and Marathi.
Sanskritization of Hindi brought it closer to many rural dialects but moved it away from the dialects spoken in urban centers.</p>
<p>Urdu is written in Nastaliq, a Perso-Arabic script (right to left) whereas Hindi is written in Devanagari script (left to right).  The script is the unbridgable gap between Hindu and Urdu.</p>

<p>Zulfiqar A. Bukhari was a well known Radio broadcaster in British India and later was the first director general of Radio Pakistan.  He was also a writer and a poet.  Bukhari believed that some competence in Arabic and Persian was needed to properly understand Urdu literature.  Muslims dominated AIR (All India Radio) and refused to simplify the linguistic style and use &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo;, the common man&rsquo;s language in North India despite demands by the British and the Hindu listeners.  Bukhari refused to accept &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo; as an authentic language and declared the demand for its use as a product of Hindu prejudice.  He did not believe non-Urdu speakers could speake Urdu correctly, especially Hindus.  For instance he did not believe Dinanath Mangeshkar could sing Urdu songs because he was a &ldquo;Marhatta&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The criterion for correct pronunciation was not the usage by the ordinary Urdu speakers but the classical language from which the word was derived.  Thus Karishma vs Karashma and Atish vs Atash.  The norms for correct pronunciation were as they were set in Delhi and Lucknow.</p>
<p>Radio Pakistan purged words such as Ram, Krishna, Gopi from the classical music.  Bade Ghulam Ali Khan who migrated to Pakistan in 1947 was told not to use words such as &ldquo;Kanhaiya&rdquo;, &ldquo;krishna&rdquo; and Shyam.  Later he returned to India.</p>
<p>The political vocabulary also changed: Intikhabat replaced Chunao (election) and Jukuman replaced Raj (rule).</p>
<p>Interestingly as Pakistanis were importing Arabic/Persian words, Turks were expunging them.</p>
