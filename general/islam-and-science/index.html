  <p>Here are some quotes from: <strong>Source: Islam and Science, Pervez Hoodbhoy,
Zed Books Ltd., 1991 ISBN 1-85649-025-4 (Paperback), Foreword by
Prof Abdus Salam.</strong></p>
<p>Pervez Hoodbhoy obtained a B.Sc. (Phys &amp; Math),
M.Sc. (SS Physics) and Ph.D. (Nuc Physics) from MIT.  He teaches at
Quaide-e-Azam Uni, Islamabad; he has been post-doctoral fellow at the Uni.
of Washington and a visiting professor and CMU.  He remains a visiting
research scientist at MIT.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>(pages 1-2)</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 700 years ago, Islamic civilization almost completely lost the will
and ability to do science.  Since that time, apart from attempts during
the Ottoman period and in Mohammed Ali&rsquo;s Egypt, there have been no
significant efforts at recovery.  Many Muslims acknoledge, and express
profound regret at, this fact.  Indeed, this is the major preoccupation
of the modernist faction in Islam.  But most traditionalists feel no
regret &ndash; in fact, many welcome this loss because, in their view, keeping]
a distance from science helps preserve Islam from corrupting, secular
influences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scientific development and ideology are indivisibly linked.  Hence the
fundamental question: is the Islamic faith in harmonious complementarity
with the science of the natural world or is there, an irreconciliable
conflict between the metaphysical system based on faith and demands of
reason and empirical enquiry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(page 4)</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the heart of the dispute is the fundamental issue: science is a
secular pursuit, and it is impossible to for it to be otherwise. The
secular character of science does not mean that it necessararily
repudiates the existence of Divine.  But it does mean that the validation
of scientific truths does not rely on any form of spiritual authority;
observation, experimentation, and logic are the sole arbiters which
decide what is true or false.  Scientists are free to be as religious
as they please, but science recognizes no laws outside its own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elites which rule Muslim countries today have shown little
ability - or even desire - to address the myriad problems and challenges
of a modern world.  Of these, the development of science and rational
culture are perhaps the most important.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>(page 28)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often, diabolical theories of international conspiracy, with varying
degrees of credibilityj, are invoked as explanation fro Muslim Scientific
backwardness.  But these are not very fulfilling.  Indeed, the damage
to the collective self-esteem cannot be undone by such means, and
thoghtful Muslims must seek sounder reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In seeking an explanation for scientific underdevelopment, one must
recognize at the outset that the environment for science in Islamic
country is replete with paradoxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(page 29)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muslim modernists and pragmatists have persistently sought to
amalgamate the new with the old.  But their attitude towards science
is oftentimes a schizophrenic one, particularly in those Muslims
countries where orthodoxy wields state power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This point is exemplified by the views expressed by the Saudi delegates
to a high level conference held in Kuwait in 1983.  The ostensible aim
of the conference, attended by rectors from 17 Arab universities, was
to identify and remove bottlenecks in the development of science and
techonolgy in the Arab world.  But a simple topic dominated the
proceedings: is science Islamic?  The Saudis held that pure science
tends to produce &lsquo;Mu&rsquo;tazilite tendencies&rsquo; potentially subversive of
belief.  Science is profane because it is secular; as such in their
opinion - it goes agains Islamic beliefs.  Hence, recommended the Saudis,
although techonology should be promoted for its obvious benefits, pure
science ought to be softpedalled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(page 35)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, on paper, 133 science and technology institutions in
Pakistan.  In size they range from large research and development
organizations such as the PAEC (atomic energy), PCSIR (industrial
research) and SUPARCO (space research) to small units occupying
only a few rooms of office space.  Equipment is generally plentiful,
salaries are 30-50 percent higher than in the neighbouring India,
and perks such as foreign travel are common.  The organizations
maintain public relations offices, have good access to the state
media, send employees for overseas training, and organize
conferences all year around.  On the face it there are signs of
busy, productive, and effective activity.  But, with some exceptions,
theiry scientific research output is miniscule by any reasonable
standard, and the impact on the technology that exists or the
national economy is imperciptible.  Pakistan&rsquo;s nuclear program,
which is by far the most advanced in the Muslime countries, if often
held up as a symbol of the nation&rsquo;s technial prowess.  But the
only declared achievement of signficance is the reasonably
successful operation of, and fuel fabrication for, the single
Canadian supplied reactor located in Karachi, KANUPP.  Unlike
India, Pakistan cannot hope to design and construct its own
reactors in the foreseeable future, which is why it entered into
a deal in 1990 for purchasing a turn-key French supplied reactor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that per capita income in Pakistan ($350) and India ($300)
are not much different, the huge discrepancy in levels of
scientific achievement must be sought elsewhere.  This explanation
lies in education.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(page 37)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;, but the objectives of education were tacitly taken to be
essentially universal. modernistic ones.  However, following the coup
of 1977 which brought General Zia-ul-Haq to power, the military
government, in alliance with political parties of fundamentalist
orientation, declared its intention of creating an Islamized society
and a new national identity based exclusively on religion.  Education
immediately became a key instrument to be used towards this end.
Consequently, a number of important changes were officially decreed.
These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imposition of the chadar for female students in educational
institutions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organization of zuhr (afternoon) prayers during school hours;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compulsory teaching of Arabic as a second language from the 6 the
class onwards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction of nazra Qur&rsquo;an (reading of Qur&rsquo;an) as a matriculation
requirement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alteration of the definition of literacy to mean religious
knowledge;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elevation of maktab schools to the status of regular schools;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recognition of madrasah certificates as equivalent to master&rsquo;s
degrees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grant of 20 extra marks for those applicants to engineering
universities who have memorized Qur&rsquo;an;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of International Islamic University in Islamabad;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organization of numerous national and international conference on
various aspects of Islamization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction of religious knowledge as a criterion for selecting
teachers of science and non<!-- raw HTML omitted -->science subjects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revision of conventional subjects to emphasize Islamic values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General Zia and his followers pursued their concept of Islamized
education with great seriousness, and most of the above decrees were
implemented at least to some degree.  But zealotry was tempered with
pragmatism when powerful interests were at stake.  For example, the
government left almost untouched the exclusive set of expensive,
private, English medium schools to which military officers,
bureaucrats, and wealthy citizens send their children.  Elite
institutions such as the Karachi Grammar School, Aitchison College,
Burn Hall, and many others, boast of a content and quality of
education which is comparable to the better ranking schools in the
West.  In contrast to Urdu medium schools - which are intended for
the masses - these provide instruction of a modern and basically
secular character to roughly one percent of the the population.
Apart from relatively minor changes, they continued to function
during the Zia era as in the years before.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;The successor civilian government of Benazir Bhutto, which was not
known for seeking bold initiatives, did not dare make any meaningful
changes during its tenure in office.  With the demise of her government
and the accession to power of the Islamic Democratic Alliance, it is
almost certain that the Islamization of education will be
accelerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From colonial time onwards, the assumption had been that modern
education was necessary for social progress - and that social progress
was desirable.  This was explicitly renounced in 1977.  Instead,
the restoration of past Islamic glories was declared as the goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(pages 39-40)</p>
<p>Lost and buried in the dusty archives of Harvard&rsquo;s Widener Library
is Ph.D. dissertation, submitted in 1964 to that university by a
Pakistani student, Wali Muhammed Zaki, entitled &ldquo;The Attitude
of Pakistani Science Teachers Towards Religion and Science&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The results of Zaki&rsquo;s research are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High school students in the US understood the nature of the
scietific enterprise, and the methods and aims of science,
significantly better than did the high school teachers of West
Pakistan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The understanding of science, as well as attitudes towards science,
were found to have significant negative correlation with attitudes
towards religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;Ahmadis and Protestants indicated a significantly more favourable
attitude towards science relative to sunnis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;teachers belonging to Sind indicated a significantly more
favourable attitude&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science teachers with bachgrounds in the biological sciences
understood the nature of scientific enterprise better than those
in the physical science.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several counts on which one can fault the above study.
.&hellip;. But is this the reason why Zaki&rsquo;s dissertation met the fate
of obscurity and oblivion?</p>
<p>(pages 40-41)</p>
<p>Since 1985, Pakistan&rsquo;s ministry of Science and Technology has been
sending several hundred students every year to the US an the Britain
for Ph.D. work in scientific and technical fields.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>For example, in 1985-86, 187 students were sent to the US for the Ph.D.
work.  As of 1991, only 9 had received Ph.Ds. abd 39 have been given
M.Scs.  In the same year, 191 students were sent to the UK.  Of these,
65 received Ph.Ds.  This relatively larger number indicates the less
rigorous nature of the British system.</p>
<p>On 29 January 1986, the Centre of Basic Sciences in Islamabad
administered a test designed by the Nobel prize winning physicist,
Samuel Ting.  About 130 students from all over Pakistan, and with
qualifications ranging from M.Sc. to M.Phil. to Ph.D. took the test.
Students are allowed to bring any notes and books they wanted.<br>
This 5-hour long test consisted of 200 multiple choice questions
on various aspects of physics.  Since each quesion had three
alternative answers, random guessing would give an average score of
67 marks.  Students who scored more than 160 would be granted admission
to MIT.</p>
<p>Not a single student passed.  Not one came anywhere close to the pass
mark.  The highest recorded score was 113, and the average score was
70 - a scant 3 points above that which a group of illiterated would
have attained, had they been allowed to randomly tick off the
answers.</p>
<p>(pages 43-44)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The de-emphasis of secular subjects, and reduced levels of performance
in these, is in considerable measure a result of fundamental changes
in educational priorities.  The emphasis on religious and nationalistic
indoctrination has caused most literary works to be replaced by
moralizing essays, classical poetry by religious poetry, and the
teaching of history and geography to be confined to that of Muslim
periods and areas.  The vision of of a universalistic world
civilization remains hidden from the pupil&rsquo;s view.  Most importantly,
the role of reason and creativity in the learning process has been
denigrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The years of General Zia&rsquo;s rule also saw the virtual extinction of
intellectual activity in Pakistani universities.  Public lectures,
debates, drama, musical events and even mushairas (poetry recitals)
were virtually banished from the campuses.  In part this was due to
the efforts of university authorities obsessed with the desire to
maintain law and order, and in part to active threats by religious
student groups who consider drama and music as un-Islamic.  The
latter force has not disappeard with Zia&rsquo;s death.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>...</p>
<p>With the intention of preserving the universities from the unwanted
change, there has evolved an elaborate system whereby the university
faculty is selected so that contamination by the germs of
intellectual and professional competence is avoided as much as
possible.  This task of sanitization is one which the university
selection boards are entrusted with.  The means by which this task
is accomplished includes, among others, forcing candidates to answer
questions wholly unrelated to their subject of specialization, and
which bear no relevance to any possible professional activity of the
candidate.</p>
<p>This point is well illustrated by successive meetings in 1987 and
1988 of the selection board of Quaid-e-Azam University, which is
considered to be Pakistan&rsquo;s premier university.  The candidates&hellip;
&hellip;were confronted with questions like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the names of the Holy Prophet&rsquo;s wives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recite the prayer Dua-e-Qunoot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the Pakistan Resolution adopted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between different azan&rsquo;s?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does your [the candidate&rsquo;s] name mean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the various names of God.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>Candidates who refused to submit themselves to such questioning wer
generally turned away.  The government of Benazir Bhutto did not
repudiate the policy, and the successor IJI government has
reaffirmed it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>(pages 65-68)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether Hindu, Christian, Jewish, or Islamic, fundamentalism is
essentially about once and for all revalation.  Knowledge is inevitably
finite; it consists in whatever has been revealed.  For fundamentalist,
therefore, any increase in knowledge consists only of finding new
interpretations of holy writ.  Fundamentalists often claim that every
major discovery of modern science was long anticipated in the holy
scriptures of their faith.  Read the text carefully, they say, and you
will find it is there.  But if you dont find it, either you have not
done a good job at reading or the so-called scientific fact is false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...let me quote from a recently published book on the sciences of
ancients India [1].  The author, who appears to be an ardent believer in
the Hindu faith as well as Hindu supremacy, asks his readers to ponder
on Bhagavad Gita 2-16 which says:
&lsquo;What does not exist cannot come into existence, and what exists cannot
be destroyed&rsquo;.  This line, proclaims the author triumphantly, is
definitive proof that a pillar of modern physics - the law of
conservation of matter and energy - was also known to the Ancients
thousands of years ago.  It establishes the divine nature of the Gita,
and proves that there is nothing new which has been added to the stock
of human wisdom since the time the scriptures were set down.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still others are greatly satisfied that human rebirth is now a
scientifically established fact, choosing to believe certain
parapsychologists who claim that the moment a man dies his mass
suddenly decreases by 50 grams.  This is clear indication, they say,
that the atman (spirit) has left the body in preparation for making a
new being somewhere else.  None of these observations, however has
ever been shown to be repeatable or to have survived careful
investigation.  They are this rejected by scietists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain exegetes of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an have also attempted to derive
scientific facts from the Holy Book in a manner much like that
described above.  Among these Maurice Bucaille is by far the most
prominent and widely read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[1] Nem Kumar Jain, Science and Scientists in India, (Delhi,
Indian Book Gallery, 1985). p.1</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(pages 67-68)</p>
<p>Maurice Bucaille:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A French surgeon who turned spiritualist, Monsieur Bucaille shot into
prominence thorughout the Islamic world with the publication of his
exegesis, The Bible, The Qur&rsquo;an and Science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bucaille&rsquo;s method is simple.  He asks his readers to ponder on some
Qur&rsquo;anic verse and then, from a variety of meanings that could be
assigned to the verse, he pulls out one which is consistent with some
scientific fact.  He thereupon concludes that, whereas the Bible is
often wrong in the description of natural pheonomena, the Qur&rsquo;an is
ivariably correct and that it correctly anticipated all major
discoveries of modern science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ends the discussion of each topic with the ritual conclusion that
the marvelous agreement of Qur&rsquo;anic revelations with the scientific
fact is proof of its miraculous nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas Monsieur Bucaille appears eminently satisfied with his
methodology, Muslims who wish to combine reason with faith will
readily detect at least two fundamental flaws in it even though`
they accept the divine nature of Qura&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First it will be recognized that the proof of a proposition is
meaningful only if the possibility of disproof is also to be
entertained. &hellip;. Since believers know that it is impossible for
the Qur&rsquo;an to be wrong in any manner, all attempts at &lsquo;proving&rsquo;
its divine nature are entirely specious from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, hanging an eternal truth on to the changeable thories of
science is a dangerous business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe that in Bucaille&rsquo;s book there is not a single prediction
of any physical fact which is unknown up to now, but which could be
tested against observation and experimentation in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2 id="appendix-they-call-it-islamic-science">Appendix: They Call it Islamic Science</h2>
<p>[This is an extended version of the author&rsquo;s article published in
Jan 1988 issue of the Karachi monthly Herald]</p>
<p>There has emerged, in recent years, a remarkable manifestation of
orthodox religiousity which is, in essence. an attempt to extend the
scope of Islamization in Pakistan beyond the sphere of social concerns
and into the domain of natural phenomena.  They call it Islamic
Science.</p>
<p>Rising like a phoenix from the ashes of a long gone medieval age,
this new science seeks to establish that every scientific fact and
phenomenon know today was anticipated 1400 years ago and that all
scientific predictions may, in fact, be based on the study of the
Holy Book.  Once again, as in medieval times, theology is being
crowned as the Queen of Sciences.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ordinary secular science, according to the proponents of the new
Islamic science, has no business being here in the Land of the
Pure.  Together with various other foul products of godless
secular civilizations - such as capitalism or socialism or
democracy - modern science also needs to be unceremoniously
shipped back to the West, where it supposedly belongs.</p>
<p>== The Scientific Miracles Conference</p>
<p>I had the privilege of recently observing at close range the new
Islamic Science.  The occasion was provided by the international
conference on Scietific Miracles of Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah,
inaugurated by President General Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq in Islamabad
on October 18, 1987. &hellip;&hellip; About half the total conference expenses
around 66 lakh rupees ($400,000) - were borne by the brotherly
government of Saudi Arabia which often subsidizes such excellent
causes.  &hellip;.. it had been preceeded by two others of a similar
nature some months ago in Karachi, as well as many earlier ones.
New ones are doubtlessly being planned&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>...the following shortlist of rather suggestively titled papers
presented at the Scientific Miracles Conference by itself speaks
volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chemical Composition of Milk in relation to Verse 66 of
Surat An-Nahl of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description of Man at High Altitudes in Qur&rsquo;an.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulonimbus Clouds Description in Qur&rsquo;an.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have You Observed the Fire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revelation of Some Modern Oceanographic Phenomena in Holy
Qur&rsquo;an.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixty-five other papers of similar nature were also presented by the
pious, bearded participants. &hellip;&hellip;I felt out of my depth, finding
even the titles of some sessions to be incomprehensible.  For
example, one of these was advertised as a Panel Discussion on
Things Known Only To Allah&hellip;. I was unable to attend, but
subsequently have often wondered what secrets the panelists were
privy to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>...A selection follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dr Mohammed Muttalib, who teaches earth sciences at the famous
Al Azhar University of Egypt, presented &hellip; paper on the relation
of geological facts and phenomena to Qur&rsquo;anic verses. &hellip;&hellip;.
Mountains have roots in the earth, said the good doctor, and the
Allah made them act like pegs which tether a tent to the ground
and kept it from blowing away.  Without mountains, he emphasized,
the earth&rsquo;s rotation would cause everything to fly apart.  It would
be totally catastrophic &ndash; no mountains, no earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineer Abdal Fequi of Egypt, drawing on his experience with
armour piercing anti-tank ammunition gained during service in
the Egyptian army in 1976, gave very impressive evidence that
Allah intends us to use empty copper shells in order to destroy
such men and jinns as may dare to venture in spaceships into
forbidden regions of heavens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Munafiqat (hypocrisy) is certainly an endemic problem in our
society. &hellip;. at the International Seminar on Qur&rsquo;an and Science,
organized in June 1986 by the Pakistan Association of Scientists
and Scientific Professions, one intrepid scientist presented a
bold new scientific theory of munafiqat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arshad Ali Beg, a senior scientist at the PCSIR has a
mathematical formula by which, he says, the degree of munafiqat
in a society can be calculated. &hellip;.. So everything happens
through chemical reactions such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>Infidels + Teaching of the Prophet -----&gt; Religious Society
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;Western society is calculated to have a munafiqat value of 22,
while Spain and Portugal have a value of only fourteen.  It is
a bit of a mystery that munafiqat values are given for Pakistan
society&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a paper read at the Karachi Qur&rsquo;an and Science Conference, Mr
Salim Mehmud [Chairman of SUPARCO] proposed that an explanation
for the Holy Prophet&rsquo;s Mairaj (ascension to heaven) be sought
in Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... Science and Technology in the Islamic World, this journal
is an important advocate and means of propagation of the new
Islamic science. &hellip;.. Here is a small sample of articles &hellip;.
which have actually appeared in this journal in recent issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Some Qur&rsquo;anic Ayaat Containing References to Science and
Technology;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symmetry of Universe and the Qur&rsquo;anic Principle of Creation
in Pairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Ahadith Containing References to Jihad;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Monograms of Two Popular Pakistani Banks and Their
Probable Significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dichotomy of Insan (Man) and Jinn &amp; their Destiny</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... the last mentioned paper above, authored by Dr Safdar Jung
Rajput, a senior scientist with DESTO (the Defence Science &amp;
Technolgy Organization).  &hellip;&hellip; A summary of his principal
results in jinnology, published in the above quoted article,
is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is highly probable that the origin of jinns is methane gas,
together with other saturated hydro-carbons, because these
yield a smokeless flame upon burning.  This conclusion is
predicated on the know fact that God made jinns out of fire,
together with the known fact that no jinn emitting smoke has
even been seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;. it follows that both men and jinns are similar and
isogenotypes. QED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;. the final conclusion &hellip;. is &hellip; &lsquo;I cannot help but say
that the jinss are white races.&rsquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>A senior director of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission,
Mr Bashiruddin Mahmood, in 1980 has recommended that jinns,
being fiery creatures, ought to be trapped as a free source of
energy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Incredible as it may sound, a German delegate to the Islamic
Science Conference held in Islamabad in 1983 claimed to have
calculated the Angle of God using mathematical topology.  He
states the angle to be pi/N, where pi = 3.1415927&hellip; and N
is not defined.</p>

the total sawab (reward) earned for namaz, as a function of the
