  <p>The movements of Bīrūnī in India seem to have been modest.  The word &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; does not appear in Al Bīrūnī&rsquo;s original Arabic text on religions of India.</p>

<p>In his preface in the Arabic original al-Biruni refers to &ldquo;the religions of India: (adyna al-hind).  In other words, he was aware that what in modern times is subsumed under the category of Hinduism, consisted of various religions (adyan).  And it was the translation of al-Biruni&rsquo;s Tahqia ma li al-hind which read into Arabic terms European constructions of what was to become Hinduism.</p>
<p>This is the fact that the term Hindu does not appear in the Arabic original text of al-Biruni and that &ldquo;hind&rdquo;, while used in Arabic, is not used to refer to the religions of the Indians.  In his translation, however, Sachau writes &ldquo;the Hindu religion (Sachar, 1910, p 50).  The Arabic text does not contain the equivalent for &ldquo;Hindu religion&rdquo; of Hinduism.  &hellip; adyan al-Hind is translated by Sachau has the &ldquo;the doctrines of the Hindus&rdquo;, leading one to assume wrongly that al-Biruni conceived of a single religion called Hinduims.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, Bīrūnī rarely makes mention of where his visits took  place, or when they did; second the Kitāb al -Hind itself is lacking in positive evidence; 1 finally, so much has been written on this figure and his life, that difficulty arises in distinguishing the historical events from the legendary ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bīrūnī‟s mobility depended thus on the conquered boundaries of Maḥmūd‟s empire . Therefore, a distinction between the conquered and unconquered world is needed in order to assess the depth of his information as well as the methodology he employed for gathering information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eastern part of it stretched over nearly the whole territory of today&rsquo;s‟ Pakistan and over a modest region of present-day India. The farthest sites in the East were Gwalior, Kanauj and Kalinjar, and in the South, Somnath. Kashmir Valley was not included in the Ghaznavid empire, as Bīrūnī explains&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inaccessibility of areas: This is the reason why their [different] sciences vanished from the conquered boundaries and retired towards unreachable [places], such as Kashmir, Varanasi and the like [&hellip;].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruins of Giri Fort have been identified as Rājakiri Fort. They are situated at around 8 km north-east of modern Taxila. Lahūr Fort, commonly mistaken with the capital of Pakistani Punjab, Lahore, is perhaps located near Hund in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa State of Pakistan.  Purušwar has been identified as Peshawar.  If the identification of Rājakiri and Lahūr&rsquo;s forts in Pakistan is accepted, Bīrūnī made his observation in Pakistan, and not in present-day India. Moreover, these two extracts represent the only positive evidence of Bīrūnī&rsquo;s presence in some areas of al-Hind from the Kitāb al-Hind. Thus, two relevant elements emerge here. First, none of the aforementioned places are situated in present-day India. Second, direct observation does not appear to have been the main method of Bīrūnī; as in the case of Kashmir Valley, oral informants and written sources provided data regarding his field of investigation ..&rdquo;
